					<em style="italic">Malware</em> is the general term for a program written by a malicious user to run on your machine and do harm, such as steal data, steal passwords, send spam to your address book, and/or delete all your files. </p>

			<title>How Do I Feel about This File?</title>
			<body>
				<p id="c64df21f3ede4e78be75f6b8826ec56a">Suppose you receive the following sorts of file. How afraid should you be of each file?</p>
				<ul id="e7edb16c0eb84a3eb6d767d41fe5abb8">
					<li>
						<p id="c5e86cc105e245f8ba2c0f63946fbd7b">A plain .txt file, which you open and read on your computer</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p id="a43e497cb5d9409ba1a81d79b6eb6afb">A .jpg file, which you open and look at on your computer</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p id="c9b69b8b6b52421282a2ac1d78aefaa4">A program .exe file—a program—which you copy on to your computer and run (.exe is just a Windows convention, but I use it here to indicate a program)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p id="f1287b1f023c429985a9f465f12157b5">A .doc document file, which you open and read on your computer</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p id="d967e17f66cd4891aee16add5b45206d">For the most part, the plain files, .txt, .jpg, and .doc, are harmless. They are data that you look at, not files that take some independent action on your computer. In contrast, the .exe is an <em style="italic">executable</em> file that gives the attacker access to your machine. If code written by the attacker runs on your computer, the attacker can access much or all of the data on your computer through that program. The malware program case is the super-harmful case we want to avoid.</p>
				<p id="fd40ce79a26b43dc9d108c9b2ee0a327">Why is running a malware program such a disaster? Whatever the goal of the attacker—to steal passwords, to email spam to the whole address book, to delete all files—the program can just do that. The malware program is the agent of the attacker. Once the malware is running on your comptuer, your data is right there for the attacker to abuse.</p>

			<title>Example: Keylogger Malware</title>
			<body>
				<p id="a8c0c291ba4f4f9993d111b9d8478abe">A <em style="italic">keylogger</em> is a great example of malware. Run once, it installs itself to run all the time. The keylogger watches the screen, notes which URLs are visited on the computer, and records all the keystrokes the user types. The keylogger can send this information back to the attacker. It&apos;s easy to imagine how this malware could allow your accounts to be abused by the attacker.</p>
				<p id="f32a635bed764f069778e327dfb4cdab">This is why you should be hesitant to log in to your email account from an Internet cafe computer, particularly in a high-crime area. If there&apos;s a keylogger on that machine, it will certainly grab your email password. You can connect to the Wi-Fi in such a situation, using your own phone or tablet. Even if an attacker is on the network, HTTPS encrypts your packets before they leave your device (see the Starbucks example under Computer Security: Phishing).</p>

			<title>How To Avoid Malware</title>
			<body>
				<p id="d8689a8e1aa6476d8471de748ca84e5c">The attacker&apos;s goal is to get a copy of her malware on your computer and run it. We discuss two techniques that are used to install malware on your machine: Trojans and vulnerabilities.</p>
				<section id="a3e42f4f1d294d87ba2acf959a4640e2">
					<title>Malware: Trojan</title>
					<body>
						<p id="fe8f6e7a5bf54f31ad0f0aed771177cb">A <em style="italic">Trojan</em> derives its name from the ancient Trojan horse story. A Trojan is malware disguised as something else, maybe not even a program, but something like awesome-wallpaper-install.app or JustinBeiber.JPEG.app or fun-game.app. (Here, <em style="italic">.app</em> is used as part of the name of a program file, but in reality, different operating systems name program files in many different ways.) The Trojan awesome-wallpaper-install.app may actually install wallpaper, but it installs and runs malware at the same time.</p>
						<p id="b9470fe721184097aaec6b7b34e9a504">If the user can be tricked into downloading and double-clicking the Trojan, running it, then the attackers have accomplished their goal. On Mac OS X and other operating systems, you may see a warning when you double-click a new file: &quot;This is a program you just downloaded. Are you sure you want to run it?&quot; or a similar warning.</p>
						<p id="aab4b4ee492c4058b34a558c73d5984a">Therefore, don&apos;t run programs downloaded from some link you saw in a forum post. What you can do is Google the website domain name that the file came from and see what people might have to say about it. If the link is from a well-known domain and has thousands of downloads, it&apos;s likely that others would have flagged it if it were malware. You can also Google the full name of the download file (in this case, awesome-wallpaper-install.app), although it is harder to determine whether the program is malicious because an attacker may have copied the name of a legitimate file.</p>

					<title>Malware: Vulnerability</title>
					<body>
						<p id="e2c0f21bbf8f4319ae16dac2196c5537">A vulnerability sometimes appears in, say, Adobe Flash player or some other software on your computer. A <em style="italic">vulnerability</em> is a special sort of bug such that, if it sees a particular <em style="italic">exploit</em> sequence of bytes as input, allows a takeover of the machine.</p>
						<p id="b9ffc678da2247f4bae03a6b3ab4fd67">In order to exploit a vulnerability, the attackers host the exploit bytes on websites, post links on forums, or send links in spam email, trying to get vulnerable browsers to look at the exploit. Vulnerabilities are scary because they do not require the user to do anything especially foolish, just visit a web page.</p>
						<p id="d1aa494f7dfc435c88b61ac9ffb04b92">Such vulnerabilities in Flash, Internet Explorer, and other programs used to be quite common. However, the engineering community, having learned from the many exploits of malicious users, is very focused on building security into software. The most important precaution you can take is to make sure you run the most current version of your browser, plugins, and other software. Many programs, by default, auto-update to fix known bugs, but software that is not updated is still vulnerable to attack.</p>
