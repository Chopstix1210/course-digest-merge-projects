			<body>
				<p id="d228aaaf60404b14a320300d22f99627">A byte by itself is quite small, so we have terms such as <em style="italic">kilobyte</em>,					<em style="italic">megabyte</em>, and <em style="italic">gigabyte</em> to measure larger collections of bytes. These terms are used to measure, for example, the size of a JPEG file or the capacity of a thumb drive.</p>

					<title>Kilobyte</title>
					<body>
						<p id="b781ab557aef420da03ee7b5ae0d562f">One kilobyte (kB) is about 1000 bytes (see below for why the word &quot;about&quot; is necessary here). So for example 5,000 bytes is about 5 kB.</p>
						<p id="e8a6b818dea9483bb312d2912b42b544">One page of ordinary alphabetic text takes about 2 kB to store (about 1 byte per letter, as in the previous section). A typical short email also takes up just 1 or 2 kB. Text is very compact, requiring few bytes compared to images and sound and video.</p>

					<title>Megabyte</title>

						<p id="ef0f77b80f5e4b1e8ff87f70df0ca741">One megabyte (MB) is about 1 million bytes (or equivalently, about 1000 KB). A rule of thumb for MP3 audio is that 1 minute of audio requires about 1 MB. A high-quality digital image is, on average, 2 to 5 MB. Audio and image and video data typically are stored in <em style="italic">compressed</em> form.</p>

						<p id="ec53e25782e94e8d94ccccc0b9a5320f">One gigabyte (GB) is about 1 billion bytes, or 1000 MB. <em style="italic">Gigabyte</em> was once a rarely used term, but as technology advanced, increasing the speed and storage capacities of computers, it has become a commonly used unit. In 2017, a computer might have 8 or 16 GB of RAM and 256 or 512 GB of persistent storage. A BluRay video disk can store about 50 GB.</p>

			<title>Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte Word Problems</title>
			<body>
				<p id="db57c65c5d964b8981beb7514c1afb51">It&apos;s useful to be able to solve simple word problems about kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. Mostly this involves using the number 1000 to translate between units. Here is one example problem:</p>
				<p id="c9357f0a0f5b479dbf7bda8ae6fb08c6">
					<em>Problem:</em> Alice has 100 small images, each of which is 500 kB. How much total space do they take up in megabytes (MB)?</p>
				<p id="d3fa62f8a08f4221985595d8751f03c9">
					<em>Solution:</em> There are 100 images, and each image is 500 kB. So the total size is 100 Ã— 500 kB = 50,000 kB. 1000 kB is 1 MB, so 50,000 kB is 50 MB. The answer is 50 MB.</p>
				<section id="d36eb2c5c21f4d95a9722b26bab96725">
					<title>About 1000</title>
					<body>
						<p id="b205b293a5bb4b1ba3925ca588ad74f3">The text above says that 1 kB is about 1000 bytes. Why is the word <em style="italic">about</em> needed? For units such as kilobytes and megabytes, there are two systems. The 1000 system uses a factor of 1000 between kilobytes, megabytes, and so on, as is common with the SI metric system. Our word problems will use this simple 1000 system. There is also a 1024 system that uses a factor of 1024 between units. This is because computers are based on the binary system and memory is measured in powers of 2. In the 1024 system, 1 KB is equal to 2<sup>10</sup> or 1024 bytes. Deep within the computer, grouping things by factors of 1024 is convenient, which is why the 1024 system exists.</p>
						<p id="fee49d4a3940476882e5db6a4c555816">In an attempt to fix the confusion between the 1000 and 1024 systems, the terms <em style="italic">kibibyte</em>,							<em style="italic">mebibyte</em>,							<em style="italic">gibibyte</em>, and <em style="italic">tebibyte</em> have been introduced to specifically mean the 1024-based units (see <link href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte" target="new" internal="false">Kibibyte</link> on Wikipedia). These terms do not seem to have caught on very strongly yet.</p>
