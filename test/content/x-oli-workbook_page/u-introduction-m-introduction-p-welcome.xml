        <p id="fb03e48ee0034274b8d4e94066ee62f0">We begin with a short section to prepare you for learning online. For
            some of you, this material may be part of a hybrid learning experience in which you also meet face-to-face
            with an instructor. Some of you may be taking this course solely online, with a lot, a little, or no
            interaction with an instructor. This course is designed with learning activities dispersed throughout the
            content. After a new idea or concept is introduced, you will have opportunities to apply what you have read,
            receive immediate feedback, and test your understanding. We discuss learning strategies for these different
            types environments and give you some pointers for using this material to support your learning.
