         <title>Passwords</title>
         <body>
            <p>Computer security is a large and rather dramatic area, and it can seem scary. This course discusses the most important and interesting ideas. Protecting your computer and personal information is not that hard to do.</p>
            <p>In the following sections, we look at the three most common types of attack, organized into three broad categories:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Password attacks</li>
               <li>Phishing attacks</li>
               <li>Malware attacks</li>
            </ol>

               <title>Malicious Attacks: Bulk</title>
               <body>
                  <p>First, a note about malicious users (also called <em style="italic">hackers</em>,						<em style="italic">attackers</em>, and <em style="italic">cyber criminals</em>): Typically, malicious users are not crafting some super-smart attack just for you. Instead, they send out millions of generic attacks, snaring only the people who fall for the attack. Therefore, if you avoid the most common errors, you will probably avoid being the victim of cyber crime.</p>

         <title>Password Attacks</title>
         <body>
            <p>Malicious users could try to just guess your password, repeatedly attempting to log in and hoping to get lucky. This type of attack is sometimes called a <em style="italic">dictionary attack</em>: the attacker runs a program that systematically tries a list of words and combinations of words to gain access to an account or a server. Some attackers might know the username and try to guess the password, but more likely, they must guess both. There are 86,400 seconds in a day, and suppose a site permits one login attempt per second. An attacker could just go through the list of 100,000 common passwords (<code>password</code>,					<code>password123</code>,					<code>janexyz</code>, etc.), trusting in the odds that she will get a hit. This approach works because users, unfortunately, often choose common words as their passwords. Attackers need to guess correctly for only a few accounts, and they can do the attack in bulk.</p>
            <p>Clearly, the website could detect thousands of bad logins and slow down or freeze the account. This precaution can cause problems for legitimate users, however, so it's a balance. One simple policy is that the site can process login attempts at a slowish rate, such as one every five seconds, to prevent hackers from trying millions of different passwords.</p>
         </body>
      </section>
      <section>
         <title>Example: Dictionary Attack</title>
         <body>
            <p>Following is a real log file from a server called codingbat.com. The log file routinely records each day's activity. It shows that an attacker is trying to guess both the username and password on the account. The username for each attempt is printed in the log file, but the password is not. No doubt, the attacker is trying common passwords, such as <code>secret</code> and <code>password12</code>. You can see that the list of usernames being tried is in roughly alphabetical order, and the attacker is just running through the list in the most obvious way. What you need to understand is that this sort of attack is clicking along, every second of every day, aimed at basically all the servers on the Internet. Even though malicious attacks fail most of the time, hackers need to succeed with a only few accounts in order for the effort to be profitable. This is why you should not have a password that is close to a real word or name or that is a commonly chosen password. The good news is that you can thwart dictionary attacks by adding just two random letters to your password. </p>
            <p>Note that 49.212.7.205 is the IP address of the machine attacking codingbat.com. It appears to be in Japan—it's probably someone's Windows machine that has been compromised and is now being used as a "zombie," under the control of the attacker, to launch more attacks. The zombie is probably running attacks at many servers simultaneously, but here we see only the ones directed at codingbat.com, about one login attempt every 3 seconds.</p>

         <title>Weak Passwords</title>
         <body>
            <p>Here are some of the patterns of weak passwords to avoid, and in the next section, we have suggestions for constructing a strong password.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Your password should not be a plain word or two words put together.</li>
               <li>Your password should not be too short: 6 characters is marginal, longer is better.</li>
               <li>Your password should not be a pun or pattern that someone else would think of. For example,</li>
               <li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <code>opensesame</code>: A million people have had the idea that the password from the ancient tale of Ali Baba would make a cute password, and attackers know this, which makes it a bad password.</li>
                     <li>
                        <code>pa55word</code>: Yes, attackers know that the number <em style="italic">5</em> looks kind of like the letter <em style="italic">S</em>.</li>
                     <li>
                        <code>qwerty</code>: Attackers know this commonly used keyboard pattern.</li>
                     <li>
                        <code>4facebook</code>: Attackers know about wordplay, such as using <em style="italic">4</em> in place of <em style="italic">for</em>. Also, don't use the name of the site.</li>
                     <li>
                        <code>love2bike</code>: Attackers also know about using <em style="italic">2</em> and <em style="italic">to</em>.</li>
                     <li>Seriously, no cute puns or jokes or word tricks! Just use a few truly random characters.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>When required to add a digit to a password, many people just add it at the end, and the digit 1 is most commonly used (e.g., <code>password1</code>). Attackers know this pattern, so don't use it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is a list of commonly used passwords, starting with the most popular, basically demonstrating all the patterns of bad passwords:</p>
            <codeblock syntax="java">
					password
					password1
					123456789
					12345678
					1234567890
					abc123
					computer
					tigger
					1234
					qwerty

         <title>Strong Passwords</title>
         <body>
            <p>Passwords do not need to be super-elaborate to be secure (some sites go overboard with requiring elaborate passwords). Here is a good approach to creating secure passwords:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Start with a word, say <code>mittens</code>, and change it with a random misspelling—for example, change one letter to two random letters: <code>makttens</code>. This is not a word.</li>
               <li>You can Google your <code>makttens</code> to verify that it's not any sort of existing term.</li>
               <li>Then you can add some digits and/or punctuation and maybe some uppercase letters:
							
							<code>makttens2x</code>  is fine (simple, not a word, no numeral at the end).
							
							<code>makttens,erx</code> is better.
							
							<code>Makttens,9erx</code> is even better.
							
							<code>Makten:X,97erx</code> is probably more complex than necessary.
						</li>
               <li>The random misspelling and the letters you choose cannot be a pun or joke or anything else that another person might come up with. This is difficult, since the human mind naturally makes little patterns and jokes of things. For example, <code>xyz</code> and <code>qwerty</code> are terrible choices. The letters should be just senseless noise.</li>
               <li>Another strategy is to pick a passage in a rhyme, poem, song etc. and select the first, or last, letter in each word: E.g.: “Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder where you are.” becomes TtlshIwwya. This is easy to remember and not in any dictionary. However, you still need to modify the password with digits or other characters (!:,#).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not all passwords are crucial. A simple password maybe sufficient for sites that don't seem important. Generally, your email password should be your most high-security password. If a malicious user gets your email password, he can use password-reset to break into many other of your accounts.</p>
         </body>
      </section>
      <section>
         <title>Example: Site Hack vs. Password</title>
         <body>
            <p>Suppose a site you use is compromised (hacked). It is much, much easier for attackers to figure out a password from within a site than it is to guess the password from outside the site. Therefore, if a site where you have an account is hacked, you should assume that the hacker will be able to figure out your password within a few hours or days.</p>
            <p>The owner of the hacked site will send all of its clients an email containing a link to a site where clients can set a new password. Your email account is generally the backup access for any password problems.</p>
            <p>However, there is one important result: you should not reuse passwords across important sites. If you have a high-quality password such as <code>makttens2x</code>, and you use it for celebrity-pets.org and also for your bank account, when celebrity-pets.org gets hacked, the hackers will probably figure out your high-quality password. They have automated tools that can try your password at thousands of other sites. So long as you did not reuse the password elsewhere, you're safe.</p>

         <title>Write Passwords Down</title>
         <body>
            <p>A common practice is to write down passwords on a piece of paper rather than trust them to memory, but care should be taken to protect them. One technique for writing down passwords is to choose a short suffix, such as <code>x936</code>, memorize it, and always add it to the end of your passwords. Write the passwords down, but never write the suffix. That way, even with the list of passwords, an attacker still does not have the correct passwords. It's a good idea to inform a trusted family member of the missing suffix so that, if you are incapacitated, your family can access your email and important accounts.			</p>
