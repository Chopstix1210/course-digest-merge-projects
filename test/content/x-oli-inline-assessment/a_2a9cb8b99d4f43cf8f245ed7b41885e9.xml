         <p>Which one of the following best describes digitization of sound?</p>
      </body>
      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="0">Many times per second convert the signal into a frequency with low voltage for low frequencies and high voltage for high frequencies. </choice>
         <choice value="1">Many times per second, convert the signal into a number representing the signal's height from the midline. </choice>
         <choice value="2">Many times per second, convert the signal into a number representing the frequency of the signal. Use high numbers for high frequency, low numbers for low frequency. </choice>
         <choice value="3">Many times per second, convert the signal into a number, recording the difference between this signal and the previous number. </choice>
