      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="0">The number of transistors produced worldwide doubles every 18 to 24 months. </choice>
         <choice value="1">Transistors approximately double in cost every 18 to 24 months. </choice>
         <choice value="2">The number of transistors that can fit on an area of chip doubles every 18 to 24 months. </choice>
         <choice value="3">The speed of a transistor in gigahertz doubles every 18 to 24 months. </choice>

            <feedback>Moore's law is about fitting more transistors on a chip.</feedback>
