         <p>Suppose we receive this noisy electrical signal, which represents 4 bits, each 0 or 1. Low voltage is represented by 0, and high voltage is represented by 1.</p>

         <p>What are the 4 bits represented by the above signal as read from left to right? Write your answer as a series of 0s and 1s (e.g., 1100).</p>

         <hint>When the line is low, that's a 0, and when the line is high, it's a 1.</hint>
         <hint>The first (leftmost) bit is 0.</hint>
         <hint>The bits are 0101.</hint>
