            <feedback>This is not a strong password since "spork" is a word (although a weird word, it must be said), it is short, and the digit-at-end pattern is common.</feedback>

            <feedback>The misspelling of "spork" is better than a plain word, but this password is short at just 6 letters. Strong passwords are longer.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="2" score="1">
            <feedback>This is strong because it is not a word, includes nonalphabet characters, and is sufficiently long.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="3" score="0">
            <feedback>"Sesame" is not a strong password since it is the password from the famous tale of Ali Baba. Hackers know to guess such password puns. Avoid this sort of cleverness.</feedback>
