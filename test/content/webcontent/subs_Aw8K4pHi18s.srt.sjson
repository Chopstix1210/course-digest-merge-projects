    "This is a, going to be a very short section. I just want to add on", 
    "an additional test that happens to work very well with the baby name data. So this is", 
    "going to be an alternative to the == that we were using before on", 
    "the baby name data. And I want to show you these functions, which are called", 
    "startsWith and endsWith. And these work on strings. And to explain it, I&#39;ll just", 
    "look at the code in my example here. The way this works. Is, all this is the same as we&#39;ve seen before. I&#39;ve opened the table,", 
    "I have the loop, they have the if-statement, where I&#39;m", 
    "looking at each row. So we&#39;ve just look at the task left right here. So, the first", 
    "part of the task is the same as we&#39;ve done before. So, I say row.getField(&quot;name&quot;) so", 
    "I&#39;m pulling the name out of the row, and that&#39;s a string. And previously we&#39;ve done", 
    "examples like, oh, is it equal to &quot;Abby&quot; or &quot;Robert&quot; or whatever, with the ==-test.", 
    "The way these startsWith and endsWith -functions work, is the syntax is", 
    "kind of funny. It has a dot... And you just tag it right on to the right hand", 
    "side of the name so I get out the name and I immediately say .startsWith. And", 
    "then, inside of the parenthesis for the startsWith, you could just say anything.", 
    "So here I say &quot;Ab&quot;. And what that tests is, does the name begin with the letters &quot;Ab&quot;?", 
    "And if it does it&#39;s true, the startsWith is true, and if it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s false. So it,", 
    "it kinda reads. You know, does, does, does the name start with &quot;Ab&quot;? So, let&#39;s just", 
    "try it. So if I just run this, what you&#39;ll see is it&#39;s gone through the 2,000 rows,", 
    "and it&#39;s just picked out, we&#39;re gonna see they all start with &quot;Ab&quot;. It&#39;s just; it was", 
    "true, for all of those. So whatever I type here. We&#39;re gonna get rows where the name", 
    "begins with that, So, I can type... I don&#39;t know, we&#39;ll reverse it. I can type", 
    "in &quot;Ba&quot;, oh, there&#39;s not that many. Or I can type maybe just uppercase &quot;A&quot;, not two letters.", 
    "We&#39;re gonna get quite a lot, quite a lot of names, beginning with &quot;A&quot;. If I", 
    "type a lower case &quot;a&quot; here, And I run. We actually get no output. And what&#39;s going", 
    "on there is in the computer the upper case &quot;A&quot; and the lower case &quot;a&quot;, those are", 
    "just two different letters. And so in this data the names all begin with an upper", 
    "case letter and then all the other letters are lower case. So startingWith(&quot;a&quot;)", 
    "- that&#39;s a subtlety, but that has zero results, whereas if I put an upper", 
    "case &quot;A&quot; here and run it then we get them all.", 
    "Right, and you can even see how yea, they begin with an upper case letter then later", 
    "letters are lower case. So you just need to know that on the test. What else was I", 
    "going to do here? Let&#39;s try &quot;Z&quot;. So if I look for startsWith(&quot;Z&quot;), then we get all", 
    "the names; there&#39;s a few there. Or I could narrow it. I could say, oh well, maybe", 
    "it has to start with &quot;Za&quot;. Then we get fewer. And maybe I could say &quot;Zai&quot;.", 
    "Then we get down to just four, And then I could say it like, I&#39;ll say it like", 
    "&quot;Zai&quot;... I don&#39;t know, &quot;x&quot;. Then I run it, oh", 
    "then I get naught. So its poss-, it&#39;s certainly possible to write a test where it&#39;s just", 
    "false. For all 2000 rows and then it just prints nothing. So I&#39;ll just back it to &quot;Zai&quot;,", 
    "and then we just do those. So that the startsWith function, And for these", 
    "first examples, we&#39;re always going to use it pretty much this way. So we go the row", 
    "for the baby data, we get the name out, and then we immediately say .startsWith, to", 
    "check the left side of the name. So, as you might guess, there&#39;s also a", 
    ".endsWith that tests the other, the right hand side of the name. So if I say,", 
    "endsWith(&quot;z&quot;), I run that, oh gees, surprisingly few of those so that picks", 
    "up, apparently there&#39;s only three names in this whole data set that end with &quot;z&quot;. So", 
    "I could say, or I could take multiple", 
    "letters. I could say, endsWith(&quot;ly&quot;). So a few more Or I, I&#39;ll try endsWith(&quot;la&quot; ). And", 
    "I&#39;ll run that. Oh, so then there&#39;s quite a few of those. You can see, I think these", 
    "are all girl names too. I mean, that, that&#39;s just culturally the pattern in", 
    "English that, girl name, or &quot;la&quot; is, supposed to be a girl&#39;s name. So, these", 
    "are, this is just two addit-, just two additional functions. And we&#39;ll, as I was", 
    "saying, we&#39;ll t end to use them for the names in the baby data set, baby data set.", 
    "But they&#39;re, they&#39;re gonna allow us to do some more interesting problems."
