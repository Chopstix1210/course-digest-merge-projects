    "know, staying safe is not that hard, it doesn&#39;t need to be that complicated. So, for", 
    "starters, I want to establish this model of the computer. I&#39;ll say the computer is", 
    "sort of like a castle. So let&#39;s say here I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve", 
    "drawn a computer and you know, there&#39;s this CPU and maybe here is a hard drive or", 
    "flash drive or something with bytes on it that you care about and let&#39;s say you&#39;ve", 
    "got your secretdiary.txt. There&#39;s some bytes here that you, you care about. So,", 
    "I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s like a castle in that, the computer has the sort of, I&#39;ve", 
    "drawn this bold boarder around like it has a real wall and the bad guy&#39;s out here,", 
    "he&#39;s outside the wall. Now, the movie is sometimes that, it seems like, well, the bad", 
    "guy just drives up in advance, you know, outside your house and they have got some", 
    "gadgets in and you know, they&#39;ll just do something and they just get the bytes off", 
    "there. And that&#39;s just not how it works. By default, the bytes are on the computer.", 
    "You&#39;ve got the computer, the bad guy is on the outside like", 
    "by default it&#39;s kind of safe - or to put it another way, when we look at the different", 
    "things the bad guy might do, they all involve being outside and trying to get", 
    "inside but by default, they&#39;re outside. So, what I want to do is talk about the", 
    "different so called attacks, the bad guy might do. One sort of broad pattern I want", 
    "to emphasize is that, it&#39;s not the case that there&#39;s a bad guy with the picture of", 
    "you sitting in some apartment like scheming like how to get on to your", 
    "computer. Generally the way it works is that the bad guys are working what you say", 
    "in bulk. They don&#39;t know about you, they don&#39;t know about anything in particular. They&#39;re", 
    "crafting not Fairly Medium complicated attacks. And then just sending out", 
    "millions and millions of copies of that attack, not putting any thought into", 
    "any particular one but j st trying to snag essentially victims who have taken", 
    "the least precautions. So if you just do, - it&#39;s not that you need to have super", 
    "awesome security - you just need to avoid making very common mistakes and if you", 
    "just avoid the common mistakes, you&#39;re probably going to be okay. I should", 
    "mention that sometimes for like corporate espionage or whatever you might", 
    "get a government or someone who&#39;s trying very hard to break into someone&#39;s computer.", 
    "That, that&#39;s sort of a different a different class of things. I&#39;m not going", 
    "to worry about that case. Presumably if you work in the CIA or something you&#39;ve got", 
    "your own class. So the first class of attack I&#39;ll talk about is password", 
    "attacks. So the bad guy could try to just guess passwords to get into someone&#39;s", 
    "account so you know Gmail, or so you know Gmail. Whatever, I&#39;m sure this just", 
    "happens all the time. This is sometimes called the dictionary attack - the idea being", 
    "that the bad guy can just sort of you know", 
    "enter &quot;aardvark&quot; or &quot;acre&quot;, you know, just sort of", 
    "like go through everywhere in the dictionary and just guess it. There is 86400 seconds", 
    "in a day that kind of, it you would sort of", 
    "guess the password of every few seconds. You know you can go through quite a few.", 
    "The trick here to avoid password problems is you just need to avoid very obvious or", 
    "very common passwords. So your password should never just be a word that appears", 
    "in the dictionary or a pun or a little bit of", 
    "work place that someone else that you know many other people on the Internet might", 
    "have thought of. So actually I can showyou an example of a, this is sometimes called", 
    "the dictionary attack (maybe I already said that). So", 
    "actually this is a live, a real example of a dictionary attack. So I run the", 
    "coding back.com server and. It turns out, bad guys are trying to break in to that", 
    "thing like all the time. So, it has, it keeps a log file which have just", 
    "what&#39;s happened. That&#39;s a standard thing for servers to do. I have here; I just put", 
    "a copy of the log files. It&#39;s really cryptic but I&#39;ll walk you", 
    "through it. So what this says is at On March sixth at 6:26:20 it says failed", 
    "password invalid user Alex from some IP address. It&#39;s actually an IP address from", 
    "Japan so what that&#39;s saying is there is a log in attempt and it failed for the user", 
    "Alex and then two seconds later there is another one and then when is it, four", 
    "seconds after that there is another one is Alex three times and then there are those", 
    "for failed one for Adam and for user Fax or whatever and so. This kind of shows you", 
    "the sort of bulk quality so there&#39;s just some bad guy machine out there and you can", 
    "see every two or three seconds it&#39;s just trying another password and. It&#39;s just", 
    "always wrong. It&#39;s just guessing what are the odds that&#39;s going to happen but that", 
    "match very, very low but that&#39;s how the bad guys operate. It&#39;s not that they have", 
    "a high percentage idea. It&#39;s quite the opposite. They have this very low", 
    "percentage idea and then they just try it a very large number of times. So it&#39;s also", 
    "I think fine that you can see they have some sort of a list of user names to try", 
    "and it&#39;s kind of alphabetical right like they are just, it&#39;s just gullible, they&#39;re", 
    "just going through so they&#39;re just going through so they&#39;re just kind of I guess", 
    "not to be too scared but that&#39;s just going on all the time, right. The bad guys are", 
    "just trying every server they can find every couple of seconds whatever just like", 
    "constantly so I&#39;ll talk about in a second if you just have a password that&#39;s a", 
    "little bit hard to guess. They&#39;re, they&#39;re only the guessing the most obvious kind of", 
    "password for that sort of attack. So here&#39;s a It was interesting, I just looked", 
    "up a list of just common passwords so here&#39;s. I&#39;m sure it depends on how the", 
    "surveys is down but here is some password so the number one common password was the", 
    "word password. Number two was password one. No doubt that&#39;s when they require you", 
    "to put a number on there and some of you out there might actually do that. I know", 
    "some of you out there may have actually done that. Here&#39;s someone as password as", 
    "one through nine or one through eight or ABC123. It&#39;s not a word but it&#39;s kind of a", 
    "pattern. It&#39;s pretty easy to match it to a lot of people trying that password Or", 
    "QWERTY. Another example is almost trying to be clever. But if you&#39;re clever in the", 
    "way that like a million other people are going to have the same idea, that is not", 
    "clever. So those are all password patterns to avoid like you can&#39;t pick something so", 
    "obvious that other people might try it. So, the good news is that having strict", 
    "password is not really that hard and some in sites in my opinion really go overboard", 
    "requiring to have a bunch of digits and multiple punctuation. I think, I think", 
    "they&#39;re fooling themselves. I think that is excessive so I&#39;ll give you some", 
    "examples on what my opinion represents good password. And I should say, I use", 
    "good passwords for, the bad guys are really interested in sites that involve", 
    "money. So banks, eBay, PayPal or your e-mail account. Your e-mail account is", 
    "important because the bad guys can then trigger a password reset which is then", 
    "sent to your e-mail account and then there might be some other repairs there but", 
    "that&#39;s maybe a way for them to get to the account with money. So, those passwords", 
    "are regardless important and then there might be some other, you know, blog were", 
    "you want to come in or whatever and I don&#39;t put a lot of thought of using a real", 
    "secured password for that so I&#39;m conscious of passwords where I care about security", 
    "versus kind of, you know, whatever throw away passwords. So here&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.", 
    "Start with the word, here I use the example of mittens just some random word", 
    "and I add a little misspelling. Change the letter, mess it up a little bit so it&#39;s", 
    "unclear right? And then here I edit, ERX just a little random something in the", 
    "middle beginning and the end or something so it&#39;s no longer, it&#39;s really not a word", 
    "anymore. That&#39;s pretty good. It&#39;s important here that the ERX is only like", 
    "ABC or XYZ or something that anyone else would have thought if is just really", 
    "random and jumbled a few letters. So, this kind of password I found to be pret ty", 
    "easy to type. If you want to get a little more fancy you can start adding some", 
    "uppercase letter and maybe out a digit in there, a lot of sites required digits Or", 
    "if you want to go really over the top, we can have like multiple uppercase letter", 
    "and lower case and multiple digits and function letters. That&#39;s probably more", 
    "complicated than as I say. So, those are pretty good passwords. There&#39;s another", 
    "problem which is, instead of the bad guy guessing the password it might be that the", 
    "bad guy let&#39;s say they break, I&#39;m going to use schwab.com as my example. So what if", 
    "they break in to schwab.com and they sort of get all the passwords from inside of", 
    "there and there are some technical details about how might that work, It&#39;s important", 
    "that for that reason it is important that you do not reuse important passwords.", 
    "There is you know, if, if you did reuse it then there&#39;s this other problem even if", 
    "it&#39;s hard to guess where it could kind of still enough from you but essentially from", 
    "someone else. So I don&#39;t really use important passwords. This does create a", 
    "problem with that is really hard to remember and I guess what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll", 
    "just write them down. Like you have a piece of paper somewhere, you know,", 
    "somewhere obscuring your house and for the important ones just write them down I find", 
    "to be adequate. And to realize again, it&#39;s not that there&#39;s, there&#39;s some bunch of", 
    "you know, the CIA or something is trying to break in your account and hiring people", 
    "to break in your house to get the passwords. It&#39;s more, there&#39;s just this", 
    "mindless bulk - and in a way just very inexpensive -", 
    "operation going on just trying to take advantage of common cases so I&#39;m not so", 
    "worried about having those written down. Also if you were in the hospital or something,", 
    "it might be helpful to [INAUDIBLE] to other people", 
    "so that they could, they could get your", 
    "password. Alright. So that&#39;s our, that&#39;s our different password, password problems."
