    "In this section, I'm gonna step back from things as small as a bit and a byte and", 
    "look at larger sizes like kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes that will actually", 
    "come up in day to day life. So, a kilobyte or KB is about a thousand bytes. So, an", 
    "e-mail, a small e-mail might be two kilobytes. A document that you're writing", 
    "might be 50 or 100 kilobytes. In general, text just plain text is one of the most", 
    "naturally compact types of data's that doesn't really take a lot of space. The", 
    "next size up is the megabyte. So, megabyte is about a million bytes or I could think", 
    "of it as about a thousand kilobytes. So, MP3 audio just is a very rough rule of thumb.", 
    "You think of that as taking about a megabyte a minute. Or if you have a high", 
    "quality, quality digital camera something that takes ten or twenty megapixels then", 
    "those high quality images probably take something like two to five megabytes when", 
    "you look at the on disc. So the next term up is the Gigabyte. So a Gigabyte is about", 
    "a billion bytes or we could think of it as about a thousand megabytes. And this is probably", 
    "the most common size that's gonna come up for modern hardware. So you could think of", 
    "4,000 megabytes is equal to four gigabytes or vice versa so to switch putting gigabytes", 
    "and megabytes the different by factor of a thousand so for the megabyte figure I can", 
    "imagine like well basically I'm, I'm dropping the right three digits to go to", 
    "gigabytes. So a computer today in 2012 might have maybe four gigabytes of RAM.", 
    "These are the typical figure. A DVD disc, a single layer DVD disc holds little less", 
    "than five gigabytes. Video data although it varies quite a lot by how big it is and", 
    "the resolution but takes about two gigabytes per hour, A cheap flash drive", 
    "that you might buy holds probably about sixteen gigabytes today and a cheap hard", 
    "drive might hold 750 gigabytes or something like that. So, the next term up is the", 
    "Terabyte or TB which is about a thousand gigabytes or it's about a trillion bytes.", 
    "And we've just enter the time when you can buy a one terabyte or two terabyte hard", 
    "drive. But other than that, it's not a term I see and you saw that much. However,", 
    "gigabyte used to be a rare term too. But then, gradually, Moore's Law - stuff is getting", 
    "more and more dense - now, gigabyte is very common. So, I expect terabyte is", 
    "coming. Just long as I'm, I'm talking about terminology mentioned the word", 
    "gigahertz. Gigahertz is not a measure of byte, it's a measure of speed so one", 
    "gigahertz refers to one billion cycles per second and so gigahertz usually it will", 
    "come out when talking about how many cycles per second a CPU can do. So a CPU", 
    "might be one gigahertz or two gigahertz. Two gigahertz is somewhat more common modern", 
    "figure. So what I like to get out of this is that anyone today is comfortable doing", 
    "sort of common forms of arithmetic with kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes just", 
    "sort of think about big their data is and where it might fit. So I've got some", 
    "problems here. Some word problems involving megabytes and gigabytes and as", 
    "usual, I've got the show button here to look at the solution. Let's try the first", 
    "one here. Alice has 600 megabytes of data, Bob has 700 megabytes of data, it will all", 
    "fit on Alice's two gigabytes thumb drive. So the first part of this is just adding,", 
    "adding the data up. So, 600 megabytes + 700 megabytes is 1300 megabytes. And then", 
    "we're left with sort of this units problem. Like, oh, we got a two gigabyte.", 
    "Thumb drive is that gonna fit? So you can think of 1300 megabytes - as I mentioned before -", 
    "these differ by factor of a thousand so to go to gigabytes; I sort of put the decimal", 
    "point after the three digits. So 1300 megabytes is the same as 1.3 gigabytes so", 
    "phrased that way you can see that 1.3 gigabytes will fit on the two gigabyte", 
    "from drive, no problem or we could have done the other way. We could say well, a", 
    "two gigabyte in thumb drive how many megabyte is that? So that's gonna be 2000", 
    "megabytes and so we can see the 1300 megabytes of data that fits on the 2000", 
    "megabytes thumb drive. All right, let's try another one of these. Alice has 100", 
    "small images each of which is 500 kilobytes. How much space does it take", 
    "overall? So, I wanted, there's a hundred of these so, they're 500 kilobytes a", 
    "piece. So, I think I wanna multiply by a hundred which I think is by multiplying by", 
    "ten twice. So, 500  ten = 5,000 and 5,000  ten = 50,000. So, all hundred images is", 
    "gonna be 50,000 kilobytes, And then expressed in megabytes. I'll just take the", 
    "left two digits here, that's gonna be 50 megabytes so 50 million bytes so the", 
    "images are fairly small. So, 100 of them, doesn't add up to that much. All right", 
    "last problem, I'll say you're a ghost hunting group that wants to record sound", 
    "from a haunted Stanford classroom for twenty hours as MP3 audio files. How much", 
    "data is that gonna expressed in gigabytes? So first I'll work out just how many", 
    "minutes that's gonna be. So twenty hours 60 minutes in an hour is 1200 minutes so I", 
    "have 1200 minutes of data. And then the rule of thumb for MP3 audio is that it's about", 
    "megabyte per minute so that's gonna be 1200 megabytes or expressed in gigabytes", 
    "that's gonna be 1.2 gigabytes. So just as a detail, there's something I need to", 
    "mention which is I've talked about. Megabytes being oh, about a thousand", 
    "kilobytes and I haven't really been more specific than that. In reality, there's", 
    "this two different schemes. There's a scheme where each unit goes up by a factor", 
    "of exactly a thousand, 1000. Or there's a scheme where each unit goes up by a factor", 
    "of 1024 and that's just because inside the computer, doing things", 
    "by power of two is more convenient. A thousand 24 is two to the tenth and it's", 
    "just sort of near to a thousand so it's kinda natural number to pick. So there's", 
    "actually, these two parallel schemes. When someone says megabyte or gigabyte it's not", 
    "really clear which scheme that they mean. Now for this class I'm, I'm willing to", 
    "just not care. I'll just figure like, well, whatever. It's about a thousand and", 
    "I'm not gonna be more specific than that. That's fine. That will get us close", 
    "enough. The error you might get is maybe five or ten per cent. I, I can just live with", 
    "that. If yo u care about distinction, there is actually a set of terminology and", 
    "rules that have been made up to, to make those, to define those terms exactly. And", 
    "so if you're curious about that, you can, I had a little write up down here about", 
    "exactly what those terms are. All right."
