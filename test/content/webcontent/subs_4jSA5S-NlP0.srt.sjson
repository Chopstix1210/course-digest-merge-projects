    "Thus far, we've written code that, where there's an if-test. And if the test is", 
    "true, we print the row in the data. So in this short section, I wanna show how,", 
    "instead, you would just count the number of rows where the if-test is true. And", 
    "that's, that's more akin to what you really wanna do with computers. So in", 
    "order to do this, we're gonna have to add some novel code into, the code we've been", 
    "doing. So, it's described, here but I'll, I'll point out the parts in this code", 
    "example. So there's three things that have to be added to do counting. One is I'm", 
    "gonna introduce a new variable, Which I'll be sure I'll call count. And I'm just", 
    "gonna set it to zero, and I'm gonna do that before the loop starts running. So,", 
    "count equals zero. Then, inside of the loop, inside the if-statement, where, you", 
    "know, I, I print the row as we've done many times before. But then I'm also gonna", 
    "have this code, count = count + 1. And that's kind of a funny looking", 
    "line. I'll tell you, what that does. Is whatever value is stored inside of count", 
    "it increases it by one. So it just bumps it up from five to six, or ten to eleven,", 
    "Or whatever. But let me, let me explain how this works. So, in mathematics, this", 
    "line doesn't really make any sense. Like, you know, what value is equal to itself", 
    "plus one. But the reason this works in the computer is that the function of the equal", 
    "sign in computer code is actually more simple than it is in mathematics. And the", 
    "key thing to understand is that it first evaluates the right hand side. And then", 
    "only once that has been resolved to get a value, then that value is stored into the", 
    "variable in the left hand side. So imagine the very first time this runs. So count is", 
    "zero and then it gets to this line. So the first thing it's going to do is evaluate", 
    "the right hand side. So count is zero, so zero plus one is one. So it's gonna, this", 
    "pile apart is one. So once it's figured that out, it stores one into count so now", 
    "count is one. So you can see right there the action where coming into the line", 
    "the count was zero and then coming out it's one. So it bumps it up. So then the", 
    "next time it sees this line, if the if-statement is true. That little value at", 
    "the right hand side, count as one. So one plus one is two, so having figured out", 
    "that's it's two than it stores two in the count so now the count has two. So", 
    "ultimately, you don't need to have a total command of the details of this thing, you", 
    "just need to know that the form, x=x+1 for some variable, it just bumps it up by", 
    "one, each time its run. So, I was saying there is three parts. We've got to set to", 
    "zero and the count=count+1 inside the if-statement and then, finally we just, we", 
    "just print out whatever value is left in the, in the count after all, after the", 
    "for-loop has run through all its times. So, let's just try this. So if I run this. What we see is that the", 
    "loop runs, and the if-statement here, checks for names beginning with \"A\". So, we", 
    "just see all these \"A\"-names. And then, down at the end, there's this one line, \"count: 258\"", 
    "So what that shows is, the for-loop, you know, the count was started at", 
    "zero. The for-loop ran all its times. The if-statement was true, apparently 258", 
    "times out of the 2,000 times. And then we get this \"count: 258\". Prints it out", 
    "because of this line, So, that one runs after the loop is done, so all that these", 
    "internal prints are done. Alright, So let me try some experiments here, So one easy", 
    "thing to do, is like, well what if I just remove this print that's inside the loop?", 
    "So, I'm still gonna run through the rows, I still have the if-statement, but then the", 
    "only thing that happens inside if-statement is count=count+1.", 
    "So just bump it up by one. So, now if I run this program. I just, I just get this", 
    "one line of output. I run it and it just says, bam, 258. So this is beginning, this", 
    "is beginning to resemble more what you think of as com-, you know, the form of", 
    "computer is taking in some massive data and kind of sifting through it and giving", 
    "you kind of a, a final answer. Alright, So, let try, try some more problems here.", 
    "And as us ual, we've got the solutions variable. How many names start with \"X\" and", 
    "then compare it to how many start with \"Y\". So, if I wanna count how many names start", 
    "with \"X\", I just change, you know, the count, and the count equals plus one.", 
    "count=count+1 I can just keep. So I'll just say, how many start", 
    "with \"X\"? So, if I run it, it says, six. So now it says oh well what if I want", 
    "to know how many start with \"Y\" well we can see all, all the structure we keep and", 
    "I just have to change that one thing to \"Y\". And its seventeen, so I guess more names", 
    "start with \"Y\", a lot more names start with \"Y\" than with \"X\". Then it says, for the third", 
    "one, how many girl names begin with \"A\", then change to count how many boy names", 
    "begin with \"A\". All right so this is going to bring in material from last time, I", 
    "wan't to use an and here. So I'll say, startsWith(\"A\"). I'll say and (\"&&\") row.getField(\"gender\")==\"girl\"", 
    "So that's the task, and then inside I just say", 
    "count=count+1. Alright, a hundred sixty nine, So the, the follow up question is", 
    "how many boy names. So for boy I would just change this. So this notion of the if", 
    "and the task are really, is the same for counting. It's really just where as previously we", 
    "would have said print(row) now I just have this count=count+1 so I can do the counting.", 
    "[inaudible] so more grow names [inaudible]. Okay, so that's our first", 
    "look at basic counting. So let's try some exercises."
