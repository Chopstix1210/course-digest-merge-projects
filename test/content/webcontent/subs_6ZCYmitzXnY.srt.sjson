    "So the second class of attack I&#39;m talking about here is called phishing And it&#39;s", 
    "spelled with a ph, phishing And the idea here with phishing is that. You are the", 
    "fish. So the bad guy is putting out this bait and trying to trick you into", 
    "revealing most commonly your password or, or something that the, the bad guy wants.", 
    "So no doubt you have received many e-mails that claim to be from eBay or PayPal or", 
    "you know, anything to do with money were really those are fishing attempts whose", 
    "trying to trick you of giving up your password. The e-mail might say something", 
    "provocative to try and get you to click. It might say oh, fraud emergency click now", 
    "or whatever. Something to try and get you to react in a moment, So, I&#39;ll scroll down", 
    "here and show you. This is this is an example Of a phishing e-mail I got And it,", 
    "I guess the thing about phishing e-mails is they, they look realistic. So this is a", 
    "forgery of an e-mail that claims to be from me based so that they can get the", 
    "art, you know, the logo and the text and of course that&#39;s very easy for them to", 
    "copy it so it, it&#39;s looks always done perfectly but it might look really correct", 
    "And the trick here is really the links. So, if you look out, you know, there is a", 
    "link here and a link here, there&#39;s also links in this thing And If I click any of", 
    "those, this is just a picture of the e-mail But, if I were to click one of", 
    "those, the trick is It does not lead to a page that&#39;s actually an eBay page. It", 
    "leads to a fake eBay page, a phishing page with a, with in prompt for me with a user", 
    "name and password and the idea is that fake phishing page, the bad guys using", 
    "that just to get my password for me. So it&#39;s, it&#39;s a forgery. They put up a", 
    "forgery, a, a phishing site that looks like eBay and try tricking me to typing my", 
    "password into it. So, if you want to sort of isolate down to just the case, think", 
    "about when you&#39;re typing in your password. You want to look. Look wait, who am I", 
    "typing that to? That&#39;s the case you want to think about. I should point out And", 
    "sort of things what I&#39;m saying about bulk. Notice the two, two member of eBay like", 
    "they haven&#39;t bothered to use my right name or my right e-mail address. I mean, it", 
    "looks wrong but anywa y, it&#39;s just, its&#39; just the most [inaudible] thing and bulk", 
    "sending out millions and millions of copies [inaudible] question, I mean it,", 
    "it. I mean, it&#39;s tough because eBay doesn&#39;t in fact sent e-mail to its users", 
    "and so if, if you&#39;re receiving an e-mail puts you in a tough spot where you know,", 
    "you&#39;re going to try to distinguish the good ones from the bad ones. There&#39;s a in", 
    "this case, it&#39;s an e-mail. There&#39;s a very similar idea of just a website that&#39;s", 
    "maybe it&#39;s just a fishing website and then the bad guy might just try and send the", 
    "URLs to that website and put in blogs or whatever and just you know, send idea.", 
    "Trying to get people to go to the to the, the bad side. So, I&#39;ll talk about how to", 
    "avoid this problem in a second. There&#39;s a funny analogy to this, which is the", 
    "phishing which is a crime. Which I guess has happened more probably but I first", 
    "read about it where some criminals. They went to a bank, it was a long weekend and", 
    "so they got some plywood and some screens and keyboards or whatever, and they put up", 
    "a fake ATM machine outside of a bank and they put a sign on it that said oh, you", 
    "know, partner does under construction And so then, what would happen is, people", 
    "would come up to it. They would think it was a real ATM machine, they would put", 
    "their card in that would say type in your PIN and they would type in their pin and", 
    "then it would wait a second and it would say oh, network down try again later. Now", 
    "really what was happening is the machine was just recording their card details and", 
    "their PIN number. Exactly like a phishing site and it&#39;d trick them to putting their", 
    "PIN number and then the criminals went and try to drain their accounts and since it&#39;s", 
    "a long weekend, they had a few days to try and get money out before Monday and people", 
    "came back to bank and realized what was going on. So I do Google searched", 
    "preparing for this. Apparently, this is actually goes on to the state where people", 
    "set a sort of fake ATMs at different places just you know, it&#39;s the same crime.", 
    "So, it is searching that&#39;s sort of the real world analogy to the phishing e-mails", 
    "and the phishing sites. Alright, so how do you avoid these? So the first thing is, if", 
    "you received an e-mail or you&#39;re looking at a blog post or something where sort of,", 
    "you know, content really could be from anybody, you want to suspicious of URLs in", 
    "there. And in particular, if you ever get to a point where the, it&#39;s prompting you", 
    "for a password, you want to think about, wait, what page is that? Is that really is", 
    "that really eBay? Sometimes the URL they come up with might be www.ebay.badguy.ru.", 
    "So, if you certainly look at the URL from left to right, it looks like eBay. It&#39;s", 
    "only if you really look at the entire thing you could say, hey, wait a minute,", 
    "that&#39;s not eBay. So scrutinizing URL is one possible thing to do And actually I", 
    "will give you an example that so here in this other tab so you know [inaudible]", 
    "because I may count there so when I say look at UL what I mean is. Look up here", 
    "Right? I, I, I see the page down here and it&#39;s asking me for whatever but if I want", 
    "to know wait, whose asking me then you could look up here. It&#39;s also the case to", 
    "that because financial sites are just attacked so regularly, the browsers and", 
    "the sites themselves have come up with some extra stuff with those. Firefox is", 
    "putting the sort of green marking here saying hey, this is, here&#39;s a good", 
    "corporate name of that and here&#39;s the country. So it gives me a little bit more", 
    "visual queue like who am I talking to here. Now it&#39;s tough because like the bad", 
    "guys they don&#39;t need, they just need to succeed one percent at a time and of", 
    "course You could, anyone could try to pay attention by it&#39;s you know, hard every", 
    "time to, to always be paying attention. So, remember nothing else, I&#39;d say,", 
    "whenever you type, asked to type in a password, always pause like, wait a", 
    "minute, well am I typing this too? So another thing that you can do which is", 
    "even simpler is if you ever get an e-mail or something that says you need to log in", 
    "to eBay right now and fix something, you just go to the browser and just don&#39;t cl", 
    "ick on the link. Just go to the browser and just type in www, eBay.com and that", 
    "way you&#39;re not subject to the bad guys trying to like sort of trick you like to", 
    "click over to the wrong URL, alright. Right, you just type eBay it&#39;s going to go", 
    "the right one so that&#39;s why [inaudible] actually because it&#39;s a very simple to", 
    "follow if you&#39;re unsure. Alright so, as I, I&#39;ll scroll down in a second. The other", 
    "thing I&#39;m going to talk about here is normally at the very left of URL it says", 
    "HTTP but there&#39;s a variant HTTPS, the secure one And so, usually the information", 
    "is sensitive in some way it&#39;s been using HTTPS and then you&#39;ll see the screen next.", 
    "I&#39;ll talk about that in a sec. Alright, so actually that&#39;s one of our topic here. So,", 
    "https adds some, some security features that are attractive for iii.com And", 
    "actually, it does two things. To secure variant HTTPS verifies that it really is", 
    "[inaudible] or whatever on the other end And there&#39;s some technical measures you", 
    "can make there where [inaudible] have the file certificate and do some other", 
    "paperwork so that, that can be verified for Hats. So, that&#39;s good. That helps with", 
    "anti-phishing. The other thing that HTTPS does is it encrypts And so the packets", 
    "that are going to be sent from my browser over to schwab.com and back and forth,", 
    "whatever both ways they&#39;re in, HTTPS provide encryption. U, so, I don&#39;t think I", 
    "have talked about encryption up to now But, what encryption does Is it scrambles", 
    "the data And it in one end, you know what, in my browser, it&#39;s going to scramble the", 
    "data and then put in on the wire And the result is if a bad guy intercepts the", 
    "data, he&#39;s just going to [inaudible] them. They can&#39;t read it and they can&#39;t forget", 
    "you know, put stuff into the conversation and likewise for the packets coming back", 
    "with my data. So you may remember from the networking section and talk about how on", 
    "Internet or WiFi, when my computer broadcasts a packet, its broadcast for", 
    "everybody around me can just see it. And so and after question would be so if I&#39;m", 
    "on my computer and I&#39;m going to log in t o, I&#39;m going to type my password to", 
    "swipe.com, is that password just going to be visible to everybody. Can [inaudible]", 
    "feed me or if they are listening and could they just see it And so the [inaudible].", 
    "So, I did this an experiment actually so what I did. There&#39;s a picture of it so I", 
    "went to Starbucks. There was like, and I just logged into their free Wi-Fi And so I", 
    "just got my coffee here, I&#39;m sitting and then, and there must have been at least 50", 
    "other people around there and like 48 of them have laptops and I&#39;m sure. Many of", 
    "those, probably multiple of those laptops have some kind of malware that have broken", 
    "into the laptop and was like messing around and the bad guys famously are very", 
    "interested in financial sites so they might have been kind of sniff around", 
    "before trying to detect a log in to [inaudible] or something. So, I, I went to", 
    "Starbucks, I did this and I typed in my password and I hit return And I, like that", 
    "was fine, like it didn&#39;t caused me problems. The reason is HTTPS. That if you", 
    "look at the Schwab [inaudible] just small here but when I went to the Schwab page,", 
    "it was an HTTPS. Connection and so that packet went on in my computer here when I", 
    "typed in my password in here returned, it was being encrypted and then the packet", 
    "was sent out. So, even though all the people around me, they&#39;re, you know,", 
    "they&#39;re one or two. Their computers could have been intercepting with packets that I", 
    "am sending and they could look at them but because they were encrypted, it would just", 
    "look like yours. They could, you know, see my password is. So, in fact, I did this", 
    "and. You know, it&#39;s always hard to know that you haven&#39;t been hacked but, yeah, my", 
    "account still has money in it whatever, you know, technically yes, that&#39;s, that&#39;s", 
    "a finding too. So, anyway, that sort of, you know, demonstrates what is, what is", 
    "[inaudible] me. Why how would that help you. Another thing I should point out is", 
    "if my laptop have Malware on it like somehow earlier, my machine have been", 
    "compromised and the bad guy have controlled my machine, then H TTPS would", 
    "not help. Right, the, the so Malware on your, if it gets on your machine, it could", 
    "observe what you&#39;re typing and keep logs and send information and stuff, whatever", 
    "you like, your, your [inaudible] needs to wipe the machine. But in terms of putting", 
    "some packets out there, HTTPS is a good solution. Alright. So, that was the second", 
    "types of attacks."
