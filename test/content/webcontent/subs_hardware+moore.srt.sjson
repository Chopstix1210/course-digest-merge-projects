    "this is just a short, neat Moore&#39;s Law example", 
    "this is a maglite brand XL 200 flashlight", 
    "it&#39;s not the fanciest for brightest flashlight you can buy it just kinda", 
    "medium fancy in medium right", 
    "and I like that uses just regular AAA batteries", 
    "so I with LED technology and flashlights that this is a problem that they cannot", 
    "be", 
    "very very bright and so you to want to have some adjustment right so it&#39;s not", 
    "just", 
    "super bright all the time um so you want to be", 
    "the brightness to be adjustable but you still want to be waterproof and pretty", 
    "rugged", 
    "so that suggests well you don&#39;t have like a knob on here you turn you could", 
    "just imagine that breaking off for causing all sorts probs", 
    "so this flashlight solves that problem in a kind of neat way so the way it works", 
    "so I will click it on here comment click on hold the button", 
    "and then as I move my elbow what happens is", 
    "it translates the rotation of the Flash Lite", 
    "into brightness so at this position it&#39;s full bright and then as I rotate", 
    "down it goes down to like 10 percent bright so what&#39;s going on is there&#39;s an", 
    "accelerometer chips sort of a gravity", 
    "measuring chip inside here and inside the flashlight it can measure just in", 
    "degrees right what", 
    "is the rotation up the flashlight and it&#39;s very easy for a computer", 
    "to notice what the degrees were right when I first click the button", 
    "and then to just measure what the difference is you know ten degrees or", 
    "twenty reason just translate that into a brightness setting", 
    "very natural little you know inside a loop a little truck little translation", 
    "for the computer to do", 
    "arm now we could quibble if like this is really a", 
    "great interface because it&#39;s not something you would think was there just", 
    "when you pick a flashlight up right that by moving your elbow around around and that&#39;s going to adjust it", 
    " ", 
    "you probably have to read the instructions arm but given that I still", 
    "think it&#39;s a pretty elegant way to get the information into the flashlight", 
    "without requiring a hole", 
    "I&#39;m so I think that&#39;s neat now really what&#39;s going on", 
    "I would say this is a moore&#39;s law example  twenty years ago it would have been", 
    "crazy talk about", 
    "miniturizing a computer and putting it inside a flashlight I do have been too", 
    "expensive and too big in taking too much power", 
    "and now none other things are a problem and so", 
    "with the computer chip available it is sort of enables creative solutions like", 
    "this", 
    "usually think of Moore&#39;s Law as arm", 
    "being about more powerful computers course that&#39;s true", 
    "but equally Moore&#39;s Law is about computers becoming more inexpensive", 
    "and as a result showing up in more", 
    "and unexpected places and solving problems and i think thats", 
    "this is a nice example that so Moore&#39;s Law", 
    "it&#39;s not just the law it&#39;s a good idea"
