    "Just since we&#39;re on the topic of digital and analog I want to just briefly show you", 
    "some examples of images and sound and just talk about video a little bit. Just so,", 
    "cause you can see it. So, as I say before, JPEG is like the, the famous lossy", 
    "format. So of course, We&#39;ve all seen this image [laugh]. The famous yellow flowers", 
    "image. So what happens with JPEG which stands for a Joint Photographic Expert", 
    "Group which was a committee that met years ago to just set up a standard for well what", 
    "should be the format for storing a compressed image and what&#39;s funny because", 
    "I&#39;m sure that committee was just like A complete dusty back water at the time and", 
    "that JPEG has turned out to be like the Rosetta Stone right? Every phone, every", 
    "computer... It&#39;s just being used constantly like they, they could never have imagined", 
    "a wide spread that, that work was kind of end up being. So that&#39;s in JPEG is a free", 
    "and open standard. So anyone is, no permission is required to use it and it,", 
    "it has that quality of standards that if one, if my digital camera formats images", 
    "as JPEGs in that format which is just, it&#39;s about bytes so it formats the bytes", 
    "as JPEG that it can confident that, that data can be handed to a web browsers or a", 
    "phone or any sort of a hardware out there and the designers of that hardware have", 
    "also read the JPEG&#39;s standard and so they know how the byte should be arrange and so", 
    "that my image taking for in place. Works everywhere and so that&#39;s the, the classic", 
    "advantage of standards. So, when a J, when an image is recorded in JPEG, there is", 
    "this knob. Of how compressed should the image be. And I want you to think of this", 
    "as, I&#39;m going to call the Q number, the quality number and I&#39;m just going to", 
    "imagine, it ranges from one to ten. So, let&#39;s say when the Q number is set at ten.", 
    "The least amount of throwing out data happens so the quality is going to be the", 
    "highest And the amount of space that takes up is going to be the biggest. Right, so", 
    "if I turn it up to Q10, it&#39;s like, you know, some. So, you know, millions have", 
    "landed here like you&#39;re taking the picture. You know, like, wow I really", 
    "don&#39;t want to have any mess ups so I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll record with highest data but it will", 
    "take the biggest amount of space. So normally, on your digital camera, You", 
    "would never, no one uses Q10. The trade offs are terrible. So a typical setting", 
    "would be maybe something more like what I&#39;m going to call Q5 or Q6 kind of the", 
    "middle of the range where JPEG throws out a little bit of the data but it&#39;s", 
    "imperceptible. Unlike MP3 the way, and when I say throw out data, I felt like", 
    "it&#39;s going to make a little bit nervous but it is well studied and well designed", 
    "so the data removes is imperceptible. So the origin, so just in standard operation", 
    "with your digital camera it&#39;s probably recording the images at Q5. Or, or", 
    "something like that. That means that if you edit it later and save it at some", 
    "higher setting, it&#39;s pointless because it recorded at Q5 so the whatever lossy it", 
    "has already happened that&#39;s, that was what&#39;s recorded. Sometimes the cameras", 
    "will have what it&#39;s called a raw format for like really picky uses. So the raw", 
    "format means. No, lossy compression Just record all the bytes for the image", 
    "untouched and, you know, and then all my computer and edit it and, and [inaudible]", 
    "with it later. Okay, so this is our original flowers image, we&#39;ll call that", 
    "Q5. So, what I did is I say its successive versions of the image turning the Q knob", 
    "lower and lower. So, you could see how it is the JPEG, the lossy JPEG quality messes", 
    "up the image And the main thing I want you to remember. Yeah. I want to show you", 
    "these artifacts, is the JPEG does a really good job. It is very hard to see the", 
    "things that are introduced. The term for the little visual mess ups that are", 
    "introduced are sometimes are called artifacts where you&#39;ll, sometimes you&#39;ll,", 
    "you&#39;ll see compression artifacts or an image, the knob is being turn down so far", 
    "that you can begin to see where JPEG is storing out data. So there, so I guess I", 
    "want to say, so although I&#39;m going to talk about artifacts, I don&#39;t want you to walk", 
    "away here with some uneasy feeling were where&#39;s my data, like for the most part", 
    "this works great. I just want you to see how it works. Alright, so that&#39;s Q5. Let&#39;s", 
    "see, I&#39;m sorry, oh, I&#39;m sorry. This is how my camera takes it. I&#39;m sorry, this will,", 
    "we&#39;ll call this Q7. It&#39;s actually not documented from my camera but I think Q7", 
    "is, is a default figure. Alright, so here, I re-saved and this one takes 48", 
    "kilobytes, compressed. So, here I saved it as Q5. So, I turned the knob down and now", 
    "it takes 29 kilobytes so that was saving about what, twenty or 30 percent less", 
    "space and I look between these two and I, I, I just cannot see any difference. Like,", 
    "like it saved twenty percent but like I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t see it. So I, I keep", 
    "turning the nerve. I&#39;m going to turn the knob lower. Okay so here, I turned the", 
    "knob down to Q1, the absolute lowest possible. And now it takes up fourteen", 
    "kilobytes so that&#39;s about 3X or 4X, that is an enormous compression, right? I mean,", 
    "it&#39;s reduced by a factor of three or four, the amount of bytes that this is taking", 
    "up. So if you just glance at this I think it still looks okay But, what I&#39;m going to", 
    "do is I&#39;m going to zoom in And zoom in, you can actually see the effects And what", 
    "I&#39;m going to do here, let me fix the lights a little bit here. All right So,", 
    "I&#39;m going to zoom in on this thing really as close as my browser can go so sort of", 
    "putting all the microscope so that we can see what the artifacts are Okay. So that,", 
    "that was the, that&#39;s the Q51 so that&#39;s pretty good. So here&#39;s the Q11, I don&#39;t", 
    "know if you guys can, can you guys see the little squares in the image? I may can", 
    "find a section with a short bit. Oh, there we go. So, look over here at the screen", 
    "leaf. So if you look carefully, you can see really the way JPEG works is it takes,", 
    "it groups the blocks of the image into eight by eight blocks of pixels so 64", 
    "pixels at a time and it kind of deals with those as a group that does some of the", 
    "compression by that group And so, if you, you look at this very carefully, you can", 
    "actually see the sort of checkerboard pattern that&#39;s coming about because of the", 
    "because of the blocks. So, that is one JPEG artifact, probably you might see.", 
    "Another thing which you can see here at the edge of flower, See there&#39;s yellow ad", 
    "then there&#39;s white and you see others kind of like this fuzz coming out the other", 
    "side and then an area that probably should be just black or dark gray. So that is a", 
    "classic JPEG artifact And what&#39;s happening is the JPEG has a hard time with", 
    "boundaries, really sharp boundaries between one color and another And so here,", 
    "what happened is the yellow has kind of blend over into this kind of snow poking a", 
    "little bit into the other side. Now, in order to see this artifact, I had to turn", 
    "the knob all the way down to one and then zoom in as far as we could But, I", 
    "definitely do see this. In real life, I see this artifacts sometimes One time", 
    "where I, probably where I see the most is actually in video encoding. So, if you", 
    "ever select in DVD movies sometimes if you see there&#39;s some video material but then", 
    "they put letters like the titling for like produced by, directed by or whatever. The,", 
    "the letters present exactly this case of a very sharp color without a sharp", 
    "[inaudible] line and then some working color behind it. And so the compression", 
    "for DVDs actually suffers from the same artifact and so this can be out of", 
    "dimension to your movie watching. You could stop the movie and go up to the", 
    "screen and look carefully and you might see the same kind of artifact so another", 
    "time, another place where this kind of compression is used is in Cable video and", 
    "specially a satellite video. So that&#39;s, the satellite TV will going to have like a", 
    "zillion channels. Well, how is it that they&#39;re fitting all those channels on to", 
    "that one dish and the way that they&#39;re fitting it on there is what have a", 
    "compression. They&#39;re taking the video stream and they&#39;re like, well, if we can", 
    "press it this much, we can feed a hundred channels. Whoa. But if we turn the knob", 
    "down another notch, then we can feed in a 150 channels. And so the tendency has been", 
    "just like advertising avenue works and just so you can advertise a lot of", 
    "channels. The tendency has been, in my experience that the compressive have a", 
    "pretty have [inaudible] so they can have a lot of channels. So, so, it uses a few", 
    "bytes so it can feed up the most channels. All right Let me turn the, Let&#39;s back up", 
    "here a little bit. Okay so zooming back out here. Okay there we go. Okay, there", 
    "was our, that was, that was the, the most compressed one. All right, So I&#39;ve talked", 
    "about this [inaudible] before But you could work out the number of bytes that an", 
    "image should take up. So that image it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s about [inaudible] so let&#39;s", 
    "say that&#39;s 360,000 I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s 120,000 pixels say the flowers image so", 
    "you could multiple it by the height. I think I did the math for this before. So", 
    "each pixel takes three bytes, it turns out so the red number, the green number and", 
    "the blue number each takes one byte so per pixel, that&#39;s three bytes per pixel, three", 
    "numbers per pixel so you just multiply. So the number of bytes for one image should", 
    "be something like or for that image should be something like 360,000 bytes. But if", 
    "you go on your flash drive and you look at an image you have or you look at this", 
    "image, this one takes 48 kilobytes. So what is that about it&#39;s a little less than", 
    "a factor of ten. So, why does it take up so much byte? Jpeg, all right? Probably by", 
    "being lossy but probably just by being smart about how it arranges the data, JPEG", 
    "causes your images as naively you think bytes could take up a lot less space. So,", 
    "that&#39;s, that&#39;s just going on all the time. All right So [inaudible] going to talk", 
    "about this, So all those mentioned other formats. A GIF and PNG, those are So JPEG", 
    "is optimized really for digital cameras for images of all things in the real world", 
    "that have kind of texture and. Parts that are in focus and parts that are out of", 
    "focus. So, just all of qualities of real images Jpeg is organized is geared for", 
    "that case. The formats GIF and PNG are optimized more if you think of like logos,", 
    "I was saying like the Simpson&#39; s, something like it&#39;s a drawn thing. It&#39;s", 
    "got this perfect areas of color with the sort of perfect boundaries between them,", 
    "it&#39;s almost [inaudible] But in reality, you could use PNG to, to compress and", 
    "store anything. As I mentioned before, PNG is [inaudible] so whatever image you put", 
    "in. It comes out exactly the same. Png just re-organizes to take up less space", 
    "but it preserves image perfectly. Alright Talk about audio a little bit for, that&#39;s", 
    "always like AC is the more slightly better [inaudible] for that. There is actually", 
    "this format [inaudible]. So MP3 and AAC are both patented so in some sense, you", 
    "need permission and you need to pay some licensing fee to legally playback that", 
    "data. Although eventually those patents expire The format [inaudible] was design", 
    "to work around these packets. So, like JPEG it&#39;s just a free open center. So, in", 
    "rare cases you may see or for certain, If Redistributing data and avoiding, avoiding", 
    "weird legal problems is an important goal of your project then [inaudible] might be", 
    "a, a good exam, a good format to use. It, it performs better than MP3, it performs", 
    "[inaudible]. There&#39;s some of a funny, I&#39;ll just make a side note kind of making fun", 
    "of [inaudible] a little bit which is. Who came up with that name? [laugh] Right? If", 
    "having the idea was for this format to be popular, and I think this is a classic", 
    "nerd error. It&#39;s some kind of in, inside joke of referring to a character from some", 
    "video that no one&#39;s ever heard of and I think there&#39;s some Latin subtext to it or", 
    "something. So anyway This is an example of like That you want to think a little bit", 
    "about marketing. [laugh]. If you want to create something that people are actually", 
    "going to use, don&#39;t get all wrapped up in your echo chamber with your little cute", 
    "[inaudible] maybe create a name that people would actually like. So in some", 
    "ideas they tragedy like they chose this in my opinion awful name ten years ago and", 
    "yeah it caused a series of legal Nvidia problems for God knows who sends it.", 
    "Alright so we&#39;ll just talk briefly about vide o formats. So, video data takes even", 
    "more space that audio. It takes the most. In fact, video data you can think of it,", 
    "the way it&#39;s made is it a series of images so maybe something between 30 and 60", 
    "images per second And also audio data. Which then is, is you know, is sort of", 
    "synced up and played at the same time and you know obviously that&#39;s movie. So video", 
    "data right it&#39;s how were big those JPEGs are let&#39;s say, 30 times per second. So you", 
    "can imagine that, that ends up taking a lot of space. The good news is that in the", 
    "same way that I was describing redundancy in an image where a pixel and maybe pixel", 
    "adjust to its right, the numbers are maybe pretty similar so you could, there&#39;s a", 
    "room to take advantage of that and compress it. Video data, suppose I, I, I&#39;m", 
    "videoing this class, I&#39;m looking at you guys and I have, I have one graph, so", 
    "there&#39;s an image And then a 30 second, I have the next image. They actually", 
    "probably looked really similar right? All these you know seats that are green and", 
    "the wall are, all those pixels mostly haven&#39;t changed right if the ball was", 
    "thrown. It was kind of moving across the scene. There would be some change but the", 
    "law of pixels from one grab, one scene to the next would either be unchanged or", 
    "would have moved a little bit And so I&#39;ll just say, that is an additional source of", 
    "redundancy that if instead of encoding a frame just naively and obvious way, you", 
    "encoded and you try and think of it is well, how is it different from the one", 
    "that came just a fraction of a second before and you just encoded that", 
    "difference. There&#39;s a lot of redundancy to take even without being lossy, there&#39;s", 
    "just a lot of redundancy taken advantage there so you can, it is possible to make", 
    "video to start in way that takes a lot of space. So, all the video formats take", 
    "advantage of that. And so, if you work it up naively, just in terms of pixels, what", 
    "would be a colossal amount of data, it&#39;s still a lot of data but it gets the", 
    "[inaudible]. So just kind of a working number, you could think of video is takin", 
    "g about two Gigabytes per hour And the one thing you&#39;ll notice is that if you have", 
    "video data And it&#39;s in one format and you want to encode it or reduce it or whatever", 
    "in some other format. Have you ever done this in a computer? What you&#39;ll find. Is", 
    "on the computer, it takes it a long time. To take like one hour of video data and", 
    "translate it, it might take it on my computer maybe four hours And the reason", 
    "is just that the computations that trying to look at each frame and then think about", 
    "how the next frame is mostly similar but a little bit different is just complicated.", 
    "And so if you think about having a fast computer nowadays, I think it&#39;s mostly", 
    "pretty pointless cause like whatever. I just have, I&#39;m just running FireFox all", 
    "the time and like it&#39;s fast enough and then mostly my experience is based on how", 
    "fast the network is and then the CPU on my machine it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not really doing a", 
    "lot. Video compression would be the counter example. Video compression uses", 
    "everything your CPU has and more and it&#39;s [inaudible] so. So, that&#39;s of 2012. So I&#39;m", 
    "sure if I would locate this lecture in 2020 and, and Moore&#39;s law has clicked over", 
    "two or three times then that would be truly more. But then what are you talking", 
    "about that takes two seconds but anyway as of now that&#39;s one thing that actually", 
    "takes certain amount of time. So there&#39;s a few different formats. There is this thing", 
    "called the Motion Picture Experts Group that standardizes video formats that are", 
    "used on DVDs and now on Bluray disks and on actually, you know formats that are", 
    "used for like Youtube and Flash videos that sort of thing [inaudible]. Unlike", 
    "JPEG these are very heavily patented you can&#39;t use them for free, they&#39;re fairly", 
    "complicated and there&#39;s somewhat owner terms to do with that. Google to its", 
    "credit, wanted to create a format that would be the sort of the analog of", 
    "[inaudible] is to audio. A format for video encoding that was pattern free So", 
    "for example if you&#39;re Wikipedia and you want to distribute all these videos and", 
    "you don&#39;t want to be in some legal mess of like well. Do my users have permission to", 
    "watch this legally? You&#39;d like just what it&#39;s called an unconverted format And so", 
    "that&#39;s what the Web M project is. It performs similarly to the, the top", 
    "commercial code x but it is, it said to be panic numbered but there&#39;s been legal", 
    "tussle about this because the pattern holders, of course, they want to say like", 
    "Of course my patterns are represented in your technology because that what&#39;s", 
    "[inaudible] always would say but [inaudible] or some kind of payment or", 
    "something so that. That controversy continues but it is a, I, I appreciate", 
    "that they&#39;re trying to make another [inaudible] format just so it is possible", 
    "to distribute video without of these problems. There was something else I was", 
    "going to say. Alright, so there, I should mention currently, the top [inaudible],", 
    "the top video format is called, it has a [inaudible] name, H.264 is a very widely", 
    "used video compression format And I&#39;ll probably use the word Kodak there that,", 
    "that&#39;s a word that means kind of the encoder. And so, H.264 is extremely", 
    "popular. It also works very well. It&#39;s a very aggressive and a very clever in its", 
    "way that it&#39;s able to reduce a, A, a video stream down the very small file. So, if", 
    "you ever take a video with your phone or members of the little flip videos, we have", 
    "one of those. So, those all refer to, those all take the video stream and in", 
    "real time compress down to [inaudible] form. So, that is, that is very common", 
    "although heavily patented format for that [inaudible]. Alright So, last thing I", 
    "mention is that so, up &#39;till now the most common way to watch video probably on the", 
    "Internet is Youtube. You guys have heard of it? Kittens, you guys have seen kittens", 
    "on the Internet? All right, so Youtube, there&#39;s a certain amount of technology", 
    "used so that it can take video and make it work kind of in a web page. And", 
    "historically, Youtube has used this technology called Flash. Flash is actually", 
    "not a standard. It&#39;s a product. It&#39;s a product that comes out of Adobe And so", 
    "Almost everything that works on the Internet HTML, JPEG, PNG, everything. They", 
    "all have this free and open centers, So Flash is this one kind of oddity and that", 
    "it&#39;s a product and so your computer is in some sense dependent on Adobe to produce", 
    "the Flash Player and this is something that famously Steve Job, Steve Job crazy", 
    "because it meant that if Adobe did a slightly have some bugs or like cluster", 
    "job of [inaudible] Flash Player in the Mac some say it made the Mac look bad. Whereas", 
    "for JPEG. Apple could produce the software on the Mac that rendered JPEGs And so, if", 
    "Steve Jobs was like hey, if Steve Jobs is saying, hey, I want it to look perfect, he", 
    "could yell at the engineers to make it look perfect and indeed it does, Where", 
    "with Adobe, because it&#39;s not a standard, they have to slightly [inaudible] all", 
    "situation. Anyway, Adobe&#39;s Flash has been very successful but it does have this", 
    "oddity for, for how it works on computers where it doesn&#39;t really fit with the", 
    "entire rest of the way the Internet works. So, enter Html five I maybe talk about", 
    "HTML five before. It&#39;s adding some features to how web pages work. So, one of", 
    "the features that&#39;s being added is what&#39;s called the video tag And the way the video", 
    "tag works is just to summarize it is standardized as how video works in a web", 
    "page so that you could put a video in the web page just to up to now, we put images.", 
    "Like images in web, we&#39;ve been doing that for years, you just put in the image and", 
    "you just kind of work. The video tag is going to try and recreate that for video", 
    "and it&#39;s just now coming to you but I think, I think that&#39;s a good thing. It", 
    "will, in the same way that images work very easily reliably Internet, it would be", 
    "nice if video is open [inaudible] as well. Probable, okay Alright, that is enough for", 
    "today. Welcome to Knowledge about Analog and Digital and I&#39;ll see you guys on"
