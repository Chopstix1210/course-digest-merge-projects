    "So now I&#39;ll talk about this big third category so I&#39;ll just put", 
    "under the term Malware. Malware just means basically, you know, software just trying", 
    "to do something bad to you. So, I&#39;m lumping, I&#39;m doing this very broadly, I&#39;m", 
    "lumping viruses and Trojans and worms all on this category and we&#39;ll just talk about", 
    "broadly. So, the question I want you to think about is suppose a bad guy or you", 
    "know, so you don&#39;t know, sends a file to you and you&#39;re going to download it on to", 
    "your computer and I want to think about your, or I want to look at how you might", 
    "feel about that file. So, one example is, so maybe it&#39;s just a plain text file and", 
    "you double click it and its text and you look at it. Or maybe it&#39;s a JPEG file An", 
    "image, a bunch of bytes get copied in the computer, you double click and you, you", 
    "look at it. And I will tell you these two cases that&#39;s, that&#39;s fine. Even if it&#39;s a", 
    "bad guy, the bad guy just can send you a rude picture or a bad portrait or whatever", 
    "but it&#39;s just not going to compromise your machine. It&#39;s, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s passive,", 
    "it&#39;s just data, you&#39;re just looking at it. So, the scary case is if the bad guys sent", 
    "you a .EXE, a program. Now, .EXE is just a Windows convention for having files or", 
    "programs to be named in different ways but I&#39;m just going to use EXE for sort of my", 
    "[inaudible]. So the way it works is. Well, let&#39;s get to the punchline. So, the EXE", 
    "file is very bad If the bad guy can. Write a program and send it to you and get you", 
    "to download it on to your computer and then run it. Now, my castle model is", 
    "broken. They&#39;ve gotten in the walls and they can do almost anything they want. To", 
    "think about this is what supposed the bad guy was literally sitting in, in front of", 
    "your computer and clicking on the hard drive and looking for stuff there, they", 
    "could just, they could do something bad. So the program is actually very similar", 
    "because the bad guy could write the program so that the program. Looks at your", 
    "files and delete things or mails or whatever. Whatever does the bad guy wanted", 
    "to do, they could just put it in the program and then they send the program to", 
    "you, you double click the program and then just do whatever that guy wanted. So, that", 
    "is the key bad case. A program written by the bad guy but running on your computer", 
    "And so later on I&#39;ll talk about different things the bad guy might do but they&#39;re", 
    "also getting back to this. The bad guy is trying to get. Their code, their bad", 
    "program onto your computer and get you to run it. Or put another way, this sort of", 
    "the key distinction between passive things like the text for the JPEG versus program", 
    "like those, you know, those are two titles or is the active program content, that&#39;s", 
    "the scary one. So obviously something with a name.EXE and Windows say, we&#39;ll okay,", 
    "that&#39;s obviously a program. Unfortunately, So things like the doc, the Microsoft.DOC", 
    "format Would you think that this is kind of passive? But actually there is, there", 
    "are coding features in there And so, something like a .DOC can act like a", 
    "program, And in one time, this is a huge source of problem if you look for the term", 
    "macro virus. So, What you&#39;ll notice now is if you get a .doc and have some code in", 
    "it, what most programs will do is if you double click it, it&#39;ll put on a warning", 
    "that says, hey, this has code in it, are you sure you want to run it And so that&#39;s,", 
    "that&#39;s getting it in this case that what has a bad guy crafted a .doc with some bad", 
    "code in it and try to take advantage of you. Alright, So, I want to talk about how", 
    "it is the bad guys could get their program on your computer and get you to run it. So", 
    "One common technique; is called a Trojan, and this referring to the story of the", 
    "Trojan War. So, idea is the bad guys has their program and it&#39;s g onna do something", 
    "bad to your computer but they just disguise it. So you know a simple example", 
    "of maybe they can call it, JustinBeiberJPEG.EXE. So, it&#39;s trying to", 
    "look like oh, just a picture of a celebrity but really, when it&#39;s double", 
    "clicked, it&#39;s a program And here I, I use .EXE but really there are, there are many", 
    "different file extensions or ways that something could be disguised so it&#39;s,", 
    "casually it looks like an image but really it&#39;s a program. Actually an ironically, a", 
    "common way to do a Trojan is to claim to be anti-virus software. You could advert,", 
    "they could advertise it or whatever, oh, here is this awesome you know, free for", 
    "this week anti-virus program. And it might actually look like its anti-virus. It", 
    "might put up a fake screen where it pretends to be scanning or whatever but", 
    "really, it&#39;s just a Trojan and it&#39;s just doing something awful to your computer. So", 
    "I guess the key thing here is to just be common sense of when a program written by", 
    "someone you are not really sure who it is, you&#39;re copy it onto your computer and", 
    "running it What you might do is just the name of the, the, or where it&#39;s from or", 
    "who claims to write it, you just sort of Google it and just sort of be, my", 
    "expectation is that if something is a Trojan and it&#39;s out there within a day,", 
    "it&#39;s going to get figure out to what is going on and that sorts are [inaudible]", 
    "about it. And so if I Google it and say, you know, they&#39;re complaining one another.", 
    "Well, that&#39;s probably okay or obviously if you&#39;re, if you&#39;re downloading this from a", 
    "well-known. You know, you got the so-called reputable site, you might feel", 
    "okay about it. All righty So that&#39;s one Trojan Horse, that&#39;s one way. The", 
    "executable can get in there. There&#39;s another way. That is a little more", 
    "complicated and a little more scary. It was called the vulnerability. So, supposed", 
    "I mean use the Flash, the Adobe Flash format. So, example is actually in the", 
    "last year that&#39;s been a, it turns that&#39;s [inaudible] problems. So, suppose there is", 
    "a bug in the Flash Display program. So, Flash is an animation format and it&#39;s", 
    "called [inaudible] display Flash animations. And there might be a bug in", 
    "the Flash Animation Program. So, that if the bad guy craft a very specific sort of", 
    "animation. The animation will essentially. Crash or corrupt the display program in", 
    "such a way that it opens up the computer so it&#39;s so the bad guy can get in. So it&#39;s", 
    "a very, tragically bad class of in the Flash animation The Flash animation", 
    "program. So, what&#39;s scary about this case is all the bad guy needs to do is craft", 
    "this sort of attack animation that&#39;s going to take advantage of this vulnerability", 
    "and then just spread around. Maybe they could e-mail it to like you know, a", 
    "million people specially like spam or they could put it on some website somewhere and", 
    "then put out a lot of on Twitter, whatever a lot of sort of provocative like oh hey,", 
    "you gotta look at this type messages to sort of drive people to try and look at", 
    "the site and if they just look at the site. And there, they have the a", 
    "vulnerable software in their computer and just looking at the page might be enough", 
    "to get the Malware onto our computer. So I regard this is the most scary case because", 
    "you know as a user you don&#39;t have to get visiting sites but geez, that&#39;s something", 
    "we do all the time. So it doesn&#39;t take much so that&#39;s that bad news. The good", 
    "news is that. The, by far, the most common way that this is exploited by the bad guys", 
    "is there&#39;s some vulnerability in Flash software and Adobe figures this out and", 
    "within, we say a month, they update a new version that fixes it. And then it might", 
    "be six months or a year later, the most common attacks out there are dealing with", 
    "vulnerability actually in some cases, it hasn&#39;t been fixed for years. So Users who", 
    "have up to date software are immune But to the bad guys, the way that is work out as", 
    "practical matter, is there just enough systems out there which are running", 
    "software which is just been out of date for years and so they still have this", 
    "vulnerability and so then the bad guys get on to that system. Again, it has a quality", 
    "that maybe eight percent systems there are, are fixed but some bad guys twenty", 
    "percent like hey, that&#39;s plenty. So, the, the cure for, for this attack actually is", 
    "pretty simple which is you want to have. Your Internet facing software, you really", 
    "want to have it auto update. Just have it to be on the most current version. All the", 
    "browser vendors have figured this out so they intend to default towards. Just", 
    "updating automatically and so the, it&#39;s the things on your computer which are", 
    "interacting with Internet directly are the ones that are subject to this kind of", 
    "vulnerability so that&#39;s the case where you, where you want to, you want to take", 
    "care about. Also, this is the side that shows how, I don&#39;t want to pick on Adobe", 
    "here but just it turns out we&#39;ve had a bad experience with them just a year or so.", 
    "The show is having a propriety format controlled by this one company is not a", 
    "very good architecture because it meant that if you are on a Linux machine or Mac", 
    "or something where Adobe, well you are dependent on how motivated on top of it", 
    "was Adobe to push out effects on your platform and if Adobe was a little bit.", 
    "That&#39;s awkward [laugh] to have some other vendor be kind of be controlling the", 
    "[inaudible]. So I think I&#39;m interested for This is maybe one more reason HTML5 is", 
    "actually going to take over. Okay. So, you know I&#39;ve just talked about a lot of", 
    "vulnerabilities. I think that creates this atmosphere like, you know nothing is safe", 
    "and really it&#39;s not true. I surf the Internet all the time like everybody else.", 
    "I don&#39;t have any, any virus software on my, on my machine. I haven&#39;t had any", 
    "problems. It does help that I don&#39;t use my software and my software is very big", 
    "target so, maybe that will help a little bit. But I don&#39;t think weird,", 
    "extraordinary measures are required to use the Internet, that&#39;s pretty much", 
    "[inaudible]. So, I&#39;m just going to recap what I think are the things are important", 
    "to get right. Okay, number one, we had the password attack you just need to not have", 
    "a lame password. I don&#39;t think you have to have super awesome mega complicated", 
    "password. Just not lame and overuse password. We have the phishing attack", 
    "where you&#39;re going to get an e-mail or something that&#39;s going to try to trick you", 
    "to log in. On this case you want to look at the URL where you&#39;re trying to log in", 
    "so be careful or if you want to be very simple you can just type [inaudible] or", 
    "whatever yourself in the browser so then you&#39;re, you&#39;re, you should be getting the", 
    "right time. Finally, we had the, the Malware attack case where it&#39;s taking", 
    "advantage of a bug in the software in the computer and really, all you need to do or", 
    "the, the, the simplest case is just to make sure that you&#39;re an Internet phasing", 
    "software is set to be to auto update. So the bug fixes, you get on your computer", 
    "and so then like months later, when the bad guys try to use it like, you&#39;re", 
    "already protected. That&#39;s all there is to it. All right. So, let&#39;s stay safe out", 
    "there."
