    "All right. So it&#39;s such a beautiful spring day, here, on campus. I&#39;m gonna record", 
    "outside, here at Stanford campus. Just kind of sunny, park like, filled with college", 
    "students just kind of like, hanging out. So the", 
    "topic for this section is: What is software? What is code? How is it that", 
    "something runs on a computer? So when we talked about hardware in the computer we", 
    "talked about the cpu, that&#39;s the brains of the thing. So the cpu&#39;s what actually does", 
    "running, and the cpu implements what is called &quot;machine code instructions&quot;. And", 
    "machine code instructions are extremely simple. One machine code instruction might", 
    "add two numbers, another instruction might compare two numbers to see which one is", 
    "bigger. So, when, for code that we&#39;ve seen, so something like pixel set red dot ten.", 
    "That&#39;s much more complicated, than an individual machine code instruction. So", 
    "the way that&#39;s going to work, is that pixel set red dot ten will ultimately", 
    "expand to a series of maybe five or ten of these very simple machine code", 
    "instructions, such that, when those ten instructions are run, one after the other,", 
    "it sort of has the effect of setting the red value of the pixel to ten. Alright, and", 
    "I&#39;ll get into more detail later on about, how that, how that expansion happens. So,", 
    "I think a good first question for running a program is like, alright well, what is a", 
    "program? So I&#39;ll look at the, the right hand side of this", 
    "diagram. So a program - and I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll sort of use, as my running example,", 
    "Firefox - so a program is made actually of just an enormous sequence of these very", 
    "simple machine code instructions. And so, when Firefox is, is running on your", 
    "computer, that means somewhere in RAM, there&#39;s a block of these instructions,", 
    "such that running them, has, you know, does the things that Firefox does. So it", 
    "blinks the cursor, it takes URL, draws, gets web pages and all that sort of stuff.", 
    "So, the individual instructions are really trivial, right? Just add two numbers. So", 
    "how does it get from that to like blinking the cursor? And the best I can say is it&#39;s", 
    "maybe sort of like the relationship between sand and sculpture. That each", 
    "instruction is like a grain of sand. Like by itself it&#39;s meaningless and it kind of", 
    "looks like all the others. But if you put them together in just the right way, you", 
    "can build this complicated overall structure. And so that is the way that", 
    "Firefox is built out of these, these simple instructions. So the way it works", 
    "is the CPU, over here on the left, runs what is called a fetch execute cycle. And", 
    "all that means is that, the CPU will start off, let&#39;s say here, with Instruction one,", 
    "and it&#39;ll load that instruction and run it. Or sometimes we&#39;ll say it executes", 
    "that instruction. So, it, it adds the two numbers, or it does whatever the", 
    "instruction says. And when it, it&#39;s done with Instruction one, it just goes down", 
    "the list. It goes to Instruction two, and it does that one. It goes to instruction three,", 
    "and it does that one, and so on. It just", 
    "runs through the sequence. So, when we say that a CPU operates at two gigahertz, two", 
    "billion operations per second, it&#39;s these little instructions that that refers to.", 
    "So there are, there&#39;s obviously a, a big variety of instructions. But I&#39;m just", 
    "gonna point out a couple special types. So one type of instruction has the effect of", 
    "changing the order that the instruction. Normally the CPU just runs down the list", 
    "and does them in order. But let&#39;s say instruction four maybe says, oh jump back", 
    "and start executing again at instruction one. And so think about what the cpu&#39;s", 
    "gonna do. So it&#39;s gonna do instructions... One, two, three, four. And then when it", 
    "gets to four, it&#39;ll sorta jump back, and do instructions one, two, three again. And", 
    "then one, two, three again, and again. You can sorta see that&#39;s how loops are", 
    "implemented. Just arranging the instructions so that there&#39;s some piece", 
    "of code we wanna do 500,000 times. Well, you can set up an instruction to just loop", 
    "back and so, do those instructions again and again. Another sort of instruction,", 
    "or a related idea, is an instruction, well, the same instruction two here, which", 
    "tests some condition and if the condition is true maybe it skips ahead, to where", 
    "instruction five would be here. So. That&#39;s how if statements are implemented. You", 
    "have an instruction that&#39;s gonna look at some condition, and if it&#39;s, if the", 
    "condition is true, it&#39;s gonna sort of tell the CPU to go over here. And if it&#39;s", 
    "false, it&#39;ll go over to some other place. So by arranging the instructions just so,", 
    "you can get the effect of, something that we, that, in our code, looks like an if", 
    "statement. Alrighty. So how, how does a program get running and", 
    "how do we get to, how do we get to this state? So I would imagine you&#39;ve got,", 
    "Firefox on your flash drive, you know, the file. So on your flash drive, or on your", 
    "hard drive. So here, I&#39;ve stored, long term, you know, persistent storage down", 
    "here. And here&#39;s RAM and here&#39;s the CPU. So when you&#39;ve got Firefox on your hard", 
    "drive, it&#39;s a file, basically, and here I, it&#39;s called Firefox exe, that&#39;s", 
    "just a Windows convention, for, how to name a file, which is a program, but it,", 
    "it helps keep things clearer so I&#39;ll follow that. So firefox.exe, that file, it", 
    "has a lot of bytes in it, and for the most part, those bytes, are just the", 
    "instructions that make up the program, plus some icons, pictures and other", 
    "stuff. So what I want to think about is well, what happens when you double click", 
    "Firefox.exe? How does it start running? And basically what happens is there&#39;s two", 
    "steps. The first thing that happens is the bytes for these instructions, at least", 
    "enough of the instructions to get started, get copied up to RAM. So it just copies,", 
    "puts the instructions in RAM where the CPU can get at them. And then step two, just", 
    "tell the CPU, &#39;Okay, well, here&#39;s instruction one. Start executing here.&#39;", 
    "And so then the CPU just starts ripping down the series of instructions and now", 
    "it&#39;s running Firefox. So I think this leads to the question of like, well wait who", 
    "do this, right? How did - who handles", 
    "the double click? Who gets Firefox running? And so that&#39;s what an operating", 
    "system is. So the operating system is a set of kind of supervisory and", 
    "administrative programs that sort of, you know, organize, organizes the whole system.", 
    "So, in particular, the operating system manages multiple programs, and starting", 
    "and, ending programs. So a modern computer can, run multiple programs at the same", 
    "time and so the operating system sorta keeps things organized. So it, it does the", 
    "initial startup of a program, giving it some RAM to use, and maybe giving it a", 
    "window to draw in. Also, operating systems try to keep programs isolated from each", 
    "other. So each program has its RAM, but it can&#39;t necessarily just go mess with the", 
    "RAM of some other program. So that helps if a program has bugs. Hopefully, it&#39;ll", 
    "just mess up that program, but not mess up some other program that you&#39;re running. Or", 
    "maliciously, if I program was trying to do something bad to some other program that,", 
    "the operating system tries to keep them separate. So, the operating system is", 
    "really the first thing that runs when your computer starts up. So that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna", 
    "put up those first windows, and maybe show you what&#39;s on the hard drive. And then,", 
    "from thereafter, you can double click, or do other things, and the operating system", 
    "will start those programs for you. So that&#39;s really the, the thing you&#39;re", 
    "seeing, when you start up your laptop. Digital camera, it, you don&#39;t think of it", 
    "as a computer, necessarily, but it&#39;s really the same. When the digital camera", 
    "first starts up, there&#39;s probably a couple programs. There&#39;s maybe the program that", 
    "takes pictures, and the program that lets you look through the pictures you&#39;ve", 
    "already taken. And so, when the camera first starts out, there&#39;s a little bit of", 
    "administrative, sorta get, get the, the programs running to sort of show you the", 
    "interface, and then it just lets you go. Am. So just as a, a last thing, there&#39;s", 
    "sort of the, the, these, this terminology boot and reboot, I always thought that was", 
    "kinda funny. Like, where does that come from? And I-, it refers to the sort of", 
    "chicken egg problem of, like, well, when the computer first turns on, when it first", 
    "starts up, how does it. How does it get itself organized? How does it start", 
    "running a program? And this terminology actually comes from sort of an old joke,", 
    "about if you want to get over a fence, what you could just do is reach down to", 
    "your bootstraps, and pull up, and just like lift yourself over the fence that", 
    "way. And it&#39;s obviously kind of absurd. But it, it has the same quality of like,", 
    "well wait, what program does the computer run to enable the computer to run", 
    "programs. So it sort of a chicken and egg problem. So the way it works is that the", 
    "hardware, the, the CPU, has, when it recognizes that it has, it was turned off,", 
    "and that it has, it has just started up. And so there&#39;s a special tiny program that", 
    "is hardwired into the computer to run, at that moment. And that program can maybe", 
    "check, check what&#39;s hardware area, you know, do some basic early start-up stuff.", 
    "And then pretty much it looks around for a hard disk or a flash drive or something", 
    "that contains an operating system on it. And then it can start that operating", 
    "system and then, then the computer can start up in that way. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s", 
    "called boot up. It refers to this old boot strap idea. And then that&#39;s what rebooting", 
    "is. So reboot means just to sort of, we want to get a clean slate so it&#39;s going to", 
    "shut down and start up fresh. All right. So now you know."
