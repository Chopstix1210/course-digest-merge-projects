<h1>Principles of Computing Course Howto</h1>

<p>&lt; <a href="/courses/Engineering/Principles of Computing/Summer2014/info">Principles of Computing - Course Info</a>

<p>This page explains the structure of Principles of Computing and how to go through it.

<p>Principles of Computing teaches the essential features of computers to an audience with no prior computer experience.

<p>Some weeks have traditional lectures and demos about various computer topics: hardware, software, security, and so on. Other weeks in the course center on experiments where you write little phrases of "code" to get a feel for how computers work and their limitations.


<h2>Grading and Deadlines</h2>

<p>There are exercises every week. A 80% score or better is required across the exercises to successfully complete the course.

<p>For this run of the course, there's one big deadline at the end of the course: XXXXX. All your work should be completed by XXXXX to get your course grade statement.

<!-- could explain the weekly cadence of the course -->

<h2>Videos and Written Documents</h2>

<p>For each video section, there's a companion written document that explains the topic (this is the document Nick is scrolling through during the video). The document for each video is on the same page as the video, but lower down. You can go try any of the examples shown in the video.

<h2>Code Exercises</h2>

<p>For the exercises that require writing code, there is a code area with a Run button, just as in lecture. You can edit and run your code, just as in lecture. When you have an answer you think is correct, try the "Submit" button below and to the left of the code area. This will check your answer, giving either a green-checkmark (correct), or a red X (not correct). Due to a quirk in the open-edx code, clicking the Submit button also erases your output, but not your code. You can click the Run button again to get your output back.

<h2>Browser Checker</h2>

<p>Any recent browser should be capable of running Principles of Computing. To check that your computer and browser are powerful enough for Principles of Computing, visit the "Browser Checker" page on the Course Info tab.
