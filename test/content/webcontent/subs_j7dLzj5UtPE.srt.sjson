    "big, and I want to match, so this, the signal is analog. Let, let&#39;s say this is", 
    "really in the air and that is really perfectly what the signal looks like and", 
    "so I want to try and capture that signal. So, the way that this is done with", 
    "digitization is called sampling. And what am I going to do is I&#39;m going to run a", 
    "little system which is going to measure what the height of the curve is very", 
    "quickly overtime And so I&#39;m going to use as my example the audio CD format. So the", 
    "audio CD format, digitizers, sounds and is samples 4400 per second. So I&#39;ve drawn the", 
    "samples for the coarsely on the curve here but in reality for sounds you can actually", 
    "hear the samples will be very tightly spaced against the curve so it&#39;s going to", 
    "come up pretty good. Alright so here&#39;s what sampling does. Let&#39;s say this is", 
    "going to be my first sample here. The way it&#39;s going to have a notional kind of zero", 
    "line going Down the middle here All right? So that will be, that&#39;s going to be sort", 
    "of the base line and the way these sounds work is I, I&#39;ve always talked about them", 
    "going above the zero line but actually have the time on there below. So, we", 
    "record it as a series of both positive and negative numbers. So, the way that samples", 
    "go work, let&#39;s say I start recording right here, this is going to be my first sample.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to look at like well, how high is t his above", 
    "the zero line and I&#39;m going to measure it. And I&#39;m just going to have some scale", 
    "where let&#39;s say, way up here for really loud noise will be the way audio CDs work", 
    "will be about 32,000 would be the max and so, in that scale. Maybe this is kind of a", 
    "not very loud sound so I&#39;m just going to measure on that scale. We&#39;re just, where", 
    "is that number. So, let&#39;s say, that one turns out to be a 1003. So I&#39;m going to", 
    "record that number. Okay, that was a three, that&#39;s my first sample. So then,", 
    "144,000 of a second later, the curve, now, this is very, this example, the curve is", 
    "way moving much farther than it would for, for real sound here just to show. So let&#39;s", 
    "say for this next sample I gauge the height of that like that&#39;s about 1720, so", 
    "I&#39;m going to record that number. That&#39;s going to be my second sample. Now here&#39;s", 
    "my third sample, oh, 1939 and my next sample, you know, 2,102 and so on. So, I", 
    "just keep sampling this thing overtime. Now, here&#39;s can be a bunch the positive", 
    "numbers but actually down here can be a bunch of negative numbers, that&#39;s fine.", 
    "The result is I take signal in and I just reduce it to this like [inaudible] of", 
    "numbers. So there are, this is not a perfect process but it does work very", 
    "well. There&#39;s two sources of problems. Once source is let&#39;s that I was getting", 
    "this very first sample and I&#39;ve said well let&#39;s call that a 1003. What if really", 
    "that signal, it was like a little bit higher than a 1003 but it wasn&#39;t quite so", 
    "far as a 1004. But in my system I&#39;m stuck picking one of those two numbers. It&#39;s", 
    "either a 1003 or 1004 in my system and so there has maybe been a tiny error there as", 
    "I kind of put it in the nearest bucket and Audio CD ... A little bit of detail but I", 
    "mentioned, so they use numbers between roughly between -32,000 and +32,000. And", 
    "the reason is, that&#39;s the, that&#39;s the range of numbers you can store in two", 
    "bytes. So, the, the byte and its 8-bits comes back here And so it turns out, on an", 
    "audio CD, example, one sample started two bytes And so that, that kind of give us", 
    "how many different buckets and h ow many, you know, how many distinct numbers we can", 
    "have. Alright So that&#39;s a small [inaudible] I should just mention. So,", 
    "audio CDs, I think by most accounts, sound fantastic like, you know, whatever, the", 
    "&quot;error&quot; I was mentioning here is like, well, it&#39;s pretty small. The other source", 
    "of error which also for audio CD&#39;s is not a problem is like when one of the signal", 
    "had some big excursion like it went way up and then when it came down before my next", 
    "sample came in. I&#39;ve, I could miss something and it turns out for audio CD&#39;s", 
    "just for the range of sound, a sound that did on audio CD would be outside of human", 
    "hearing. So, for the most part of that, that&#39;s not really a problem. All right, so", 
    "those are the two sources of Tactically imperfection but in reality this works", 
    "really well for [sound] aright so what AI have done is I&#39;ve taken in the signal and", 
    "now what I have is just like, there&#39;s a lot of number and you can put those them", 
    "in to file or draw them on a CD or whatever. So I think that this leads to", 
    "the natural question of okay well, How does playback work? Well, I don&#39;t see why", 
    "to look at those numbers to be like, yeah. No of course you wanted-Alright sop", 
    "here&#39;s going to work. Just give me so the reverse process. So, this is called", 
    "digital to audio conversion and there&#39;s a piece of hardware that a chip that", 
    "specialized to just do this. What the digital audio conversion is going to do is", 
    "it&#39;s going to take in the numbers and I swear, the phrase that comes in mind to", 
    "this is connect the dots. So, what this thing wants to do is to make actually a", 
    "pattern of electricity that exactly follows the original signal and then,", 
    "that, that electricity then we can feed to speaker and the speaker will make it back", 
    "in the sound. So, what the, what the digital audio converter going to do is it", 
    "going to look at the first number, a 1003. And so, it puts a dot, and like dot far", 
    "above line. Like okay, a 1003, got it. And then let&#39;s look at the next sample, oh,", 
    "1720, all right. S, let&#39;s kind of put a dot that height and then it, it&#39;s going to", 
    "come, basically draw a line so like, okay, I&#39;ll connect those first two. And then it", 
    "takes the next sample and the next one and the next one and you can see so we get", 
    "these dots and other, I drew actually these straight lines between those", 
    "samples. As you could see, even though the original was in some sense curved. The", 
    "straight lines put together, it does basically capture the shape of the sound.", 
    "And as I was saying, for audio CDs because really the sample are so close together", 
    "the straight lines were, worked very well. So I [inaudible] so the effect of going", 
    "through these numbers is, is able to recreate the original signal so this goes", 
    "to your direction. Taken a bunch of numbers, recreate the signal beautifully", 
    "and the we could put that in the speaker and now you&#39;re hearing one of the original", 
    "prerecorded sound was. So. That&#39;s how it works. And also I just sort of mention the", 
    "chip that does that The DTA converter. I see that sometimes in marketing materials", 
    "for like stereos or MP3 players you know, extra awesome DTA converter so you may", 
    "actually, just a proof I&#39;m not making this up you actually, you may see that like a", 
    "box or something that&#39;s nearby. Alright, those are two directions. The sampling to", 
    "recorded it and DTA conversion to play back so I think the natural question here", 
    "would be. Why? Why go to all this trouble like, it wasn&#39;t my little telephone", 
    "diagram was actually simpler, right? I just have the microphone; I hook that to", 
    "the wire to the speaker. So what is the advantage of putting stuff and then we", 
    "would say technically taking the data and putting it in the digital domain. It used", 
    "to be was in the sound domain and then it was on the electricity domain but now I&#39;ve", 
    "put in the digital domain of just numbers and we&#39;re going to see there&#39;s actually a", 
    "lot of advantages to having the data just be in the digital domain. So, I&#39;ll talk", 
    "about those. All right, so the first thing I want to think about is errors. It&#39;s", 
    "going to be one big advantage for digital And so I, when I described that I&#39;ve", 
    "recorded this thing as numbers, 1003, 1720 or whatever. You know, all take is covered", 
    "earlier. So, really, when I say numbers that means in a computer it could be just", 
    "the [inaudible] one. It&#39;s just that, you know, the 1720, there is just a pattern of", 
    "zeros and ones to represent that. It, it does take two bytes to do it but it does", 
    "work. So, an audio CD At the end of the day, what&#39;s recorded on an audio CD is", 
    "really the pattern of zeros and ones that makes up the series of numbers that then", 
    "would feed in to the DDA converter makes the music. So, if you, you got a", 
    "microscope and actually on the D, it really is really picks and valleys, Like", 
    "there&#39;s a physicality of the ones in the zeros u, you can actually see. Well, here", 
    "in the microscope we can see. Alright, so, I want to think about. Let&#39;s think about", 
    "the C, audio CD playback. So, the way it works is there&#39;s a laser that&#39;s in the end", 
    "of the CD and it&#39;s trying to kind of pull off the patterns of ones and zeros so they", 
    "can remake the sample numbers so that you can make the music. So, what is that going", 
    "to look like? And we talked about this a little bit before in my networking section", 
    "and I would say, well, it&#39;s going to look kind of like this. The pattern, the laser", 
    "is looking at the CD and let&#39;s say, the first number it sees is a one, you know,", 
    "I&#39;ll say that it&#39;s a one And then the next thing it sees is a zero. And then there&#39;s", 
    "a couple one and then a zero. So, it&#39;s reading the ones and zeros off the CD.", 
    "That&#39;s what it looks like in the abstract. Is that really what it&#39;s going to look", 
    "like coming off the CD? It I hook it in a oscilloscope off to the laser and look as", 
    "the electricity coming out, is or going to look like that with perfect 90 degree", 
    "corners, right? Now, there&#39;s going to be noise. Right? All the little wires and", 
    "magnets and layers and CD like probably jiggling a little bit while it seemly.", 
    "Here&#39;s what it&#39;s going to look like. It&#39;s going to look like that. You&#39;ve got the", 
    "ones and the zeros in there just as we have for the analog scheme. There is noise", 
    "crowding up on top of our signal that&#39;s wha t we actually get. We get back signal", 
    "with noise. All right now, this is a, this is a little bit of a punchline moment", 
    "here. Suppose you&#39;re the CD player and you&#39;re like, oh, no. My signal up the CD,", 
    "[laugh]. It&#39;s got all this noise, [laugh] But look. Do you have any problem picking", 
    "the ones and zeros out of there? No. Right? You can have a lot noise on that", 
    "signal but the 1s and 0s you start pick them out and alright and so the effect on", 
    "the noise on the digital signal, it&#39;s nothing. Right, I can see 10111 so that", 
    "means I can have the CD also [inaudible] noise on it and I playback, it doesn&#39;t", 
    "come back like pretty close. The playback, it&#39;s perfect. Right it&#39;s just like the", 
    "signal came out ideally. So that&#39;s why or this is what is it. That&#39;s why digital", 
    "sound is better. Right? And I&#39;m going to have to kind of string together all these", 
    "steps but I can take the signal I care about, encoded the zeros and ones, so", 
    "basically it&#39;s come to [inaudible] and it gives me a lot of noise resistance. It&#39;s", 
    "not perfect, right? If you, if you draw a hole in the CD you know, there could be a", 
    "mess up big enough on the CD to really to really mess things up. But it can stand a", 
    "lot. In particular, it&#39;s much better than analog but with analog, that hiss was just", 
    "mixed right in with the sound that I wanted to hear. So this is the big jump up", 
    "in, yeah, lots of things digital. So there, now you know. That, that&#39;s how it", 
    "works Alright, So, noise reduction or, you know, noise elimination really is one big", 
    "example. I&#39;ll just mention for completeness so the way CDs work,", 
    "obviously for the 0s and 1s is its greatly resistant to little of specs or dust", 
    "whatever that cause noise. It is also the case that the CD actually stores multiple", 
    "in a sense, multiple copies of the music. It&#39;s a little bit like packets on the", 
    "network. Remember we talked about packets and resend. The CD actually has multiple", 
    "copies and the copies are marked with checksums which I talked about in the", 
    "networking section And the CD can actually notice if there&#39;s like a little tiny h ole", 
    "or something but one part of the music didn&#39;t come out right, it can go to a, I&#39;m", 
    "over some final behavior, but basically it can go to a fall back copy And so, it can,", 
    "it can swap that one in and just keep playing. And so that is another, a higher", 
    "level of air resistance. It&#39;s called air, air detection and correction that CDs have", 
    "and actually DVDs do as well. So that&#39;s how it, yeah, I can see you know, when", 
    "someone else&#39;s DVDs you could figure out like how big of a hole can you drill,", 
    "[laugh], in a, in a DVD and still have it play. I&#39;ll place for a big but You can", 
    "stand a little bit of just missing data and has another copy. That cannot, you", 
    "know so also that works, that works because it&#39;s digital that we can have this", 
    "logic in these if statements to kind of check someone copy and having if statement", 
    "that says oh, I&#39;m going to go get the other copy in some places so yeah anyway", 
    "that would work. Alright Let me show you another thing that you can do with", 
    "digital. Alright so supposed the numbers That I had coming off of my audio CD were", 
    "these. So 12,000, 12002, 12006, 12007 this is actually pretty realistic that the, the", 
    "sampling is so fast on the audio CD that the signal appears to just change very", 
    "slowly for sounds that actually you know that you can hear. Alright so that&#39;s, so", 
    "what you notice about those numbers is that they are pretty near to each other.", 
    "Right? Like even though the base number 12,000 is big, the change from one sample", 
    "to the next is like, is not very big, right it&#39;s under ten. In fact, it&#39;s just", 
    "sort of five. So, I&#39;m going to propose a scheme, a compression scheme that we could", 
    "use so that we could record the audio data and have it take a, take a plus base. So,", 
    "here&#39;s a scheme I&#39;m going to propose. What if. At the start of the audio data I just", 
    "put whatever the first number is so I record that first sample. And then after", 
    "that, I don&#39;t record any more samples. What I do, is I just record the difference", 
    "of each sample to the next. So, in this case, I would end up with 12,000 and I", 
    "would say plus two because the next sample is 12,002 and I would say plus four", 
    "because the difference between the third sample and the second was going up by", 
    "four. And so you know + one + three - five + one I just gotta put these all numbers.", 
    "So now you just have to convince yourself playback can still work so as long as", 
    "playback knows about my scheme. Like it&#39;s playback after to know the sample numbers,", 
    "So, playback would say, alright, this is next crazy this new called delta scheme", 
    "because you&#39;re just recording the deltas. So, playback, you know, alright so 12,000", 
    "is the first sample and the we&#39;ll just have to do the arithmetic to recreate the", 
    "sample. So, you could just work, it could just, you know, undo it to work out the", 
    "samples where 12,002, 12,006, 12,007 and then using those samples, feed those into", 
    "the DGA converter to like really recreate the sample. Okay, so, what&#39;s the advantage", 
    "of this? What&#39;s better about +two, +four, +one, +three than 12,000 to 12,006,", 
    "12,007. I mean it&#39;s sort of gets back to bytes. What this comes down to is those", 
    "numbers are smaller, a lot smaller and the reality is I could record them using to", 
    "your bytes. Right? If you just think about the amount of space on the CD, the amount", 
    "of little bits and values or whatever, if I use the scheme and, and then I&#39;m", 
    "[inaudible] a little bit of complexity. But basically, I could take that sound and", 
    "I can record it may be using just half this much space because I&#39;m just being KG", 
    "about making the number of small in those cases so that maybe I could just use one", 
    "byte whereas previously I had to use two bytes for each sample And I know that&#39;s in", 
    "complexity. So, that is compression. Right we talked out in all media, sound and", 
    "images all of these sort of things, they are typically stored in some compressed", 
    "format and this is an example where instead of just storing the numbers in the", 
    "total like straight ahead obvious way, we&#39;re going to have some scheme that takes", 
    "advantage of the fact and this is true for the images as well that the numbers don&#39;t", 
    "intended as jump around rando mly. But if I would get one pixel in an image and it", 
    "got certain red green blue values And then suppose you look at the picture right next", 
    "to it. Super, super close probably the red green blue values to that second pixel", 
    "they&#39;re probably really similar, really close to the red green blue values for the", 
    "first pixel And so maybe you could take advantage of that, have that some delta", 
    "encoding scheme where for each pixel maybe you didn&#39;t record what the number was.", 
    "Maybe you recorded what the difference of that pixel was versus the pixel to its", 
    "left and so then suddenly the numbers tend to get a lot smaller. So that&#39;s just an", 
    "example or essentially compression is comes up light so this is my kind of", 
    "zoomed in kind of simple example of how that might work. Now this example, this", 
    "compression is called loss less Because I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve changed the data around to take", 
    "up less space but I haven&#39;t given up any fidelity at all. If you run through my", 
    "delta scheme here, the samples, they come back exactly right. Right, I haven&#39;t, I", 
    "haven&#39;t given up any. I just add a complexity to take a plus space. So just", 
    "an example so PNG I talked about that as I think a little bit as a image format so", 
    "PNG is also laws less. It takes a bunch of pixels. It arranges them to take up last", 
    "space but the image is not corrupted anyway. It comes back professionally. So", 
    "laws less for mats I think are a little bit a little bit more rare. The more", 
    "common approach to compression is called lossy compression and so lossy compression", 
    "is going to take in the data. And it&#39;s going to cost it, it&#39;s going to rearrange", 
    "it so it takes up a lot less space. But. It&#39;s not going to repeat on playback. It&#39;s", 
    "not going to reproduce the data exactly. It&#39;s just going to be sort of", 
    "qualitatively very close. So, so, you pretty much can&#39;t tell. So JPEG, That&#39;s", 
    "the [inaudible] Lord knows we&#39;ve been using. A lot of, JPEG is actually lossy", 
    "and I, I&#39;ll demonstrate this a little bit. So, you can give it an image with the", 
    "pixels just perfect and it takes up certain amount of space. You encode it as", 
    "JPEG and it will take up a lot less space, maybe ten actually less space but it will", 
    "make certain shortcuts how the red and greens and blues are recorded. So, when", 
    "you look at it, it looks very good, but if you put it under a microscope, you could", 
    "see where it had kind of fudged a little bit to, to save space. So I can do a, a", 
    "simple example of a lossy compression, sticking with my audio sample example here", 
    "would be what if. I think I have this oh yeah, what if we just threw out every", 
    "other number? We just said, well whatever we&#39;ve got 44000 of these a second. Let&#39;s", 
    "just only record 22 thousand. And then on playback they&#39;re going to have to know", 
    "that so we&#39;re going to record this number and this number and this number and then", 
    "on playback, what could play back do? Playback is going to have all these", 
    "missing numbers right so it&#39;ll get this number and get this number then playback", 
    "is going to have to sort of fudge this middle number. What could playback do", 
    "there? You could just guess, right? You could say well, let&#39;s guess that it&#39;s", 
    "halfway in between. We&#39;re going to just guess 12,003. Well maybe in reality it was", 
    "12,002. Let&#39;s point your sound pretty good. All right But so, this is a little", 
    "bit lossy. We&#39;re fudging the data a little bit, right? So in the next one would be", 
    "12,010, 12,006 so again maybe it would guess 12,008 even though in reality, the", 
    "sample was 12,007. Now this is a big savings, right? So you, this have the", 
    "space, my delta scheme also more or less have the space maybe in a little bit", 
    "better. So you compile these techniques on where your data was originally quite", 
    "large. It, it could take up a lot less space and when you play it back, so I&#39;ll", 
    "do my JPEG example, it really does look very good. But if you got out of the", 
    "microscope and look, you could see with certain little, fudge is the word I want", 
    "to use but it was probably a better term. Little adjustments have been made.", 
    "[laugh]. So it takes up my space. Okay, so the, the two, you know, so any media data", 
    "that you played with. So, JPEG for images, MP3 for sound a nd all the video formats", 
    "make heavy, heavy use of lossy compression, Especially video data. If you", 
    "just had all the samples and you just recorded them in the raw. It&#39;s an enormous", 
    "amount of data. Fortunately the data like I said with the pixels and like the pixel", 
    "right next to it. It is, the pixel is said to be have a, have a lot of redundancy in", 
    "it but actually, there are these patterns in the data that you can take advantage of", 
    "to compress it quite a lot and have it still look very good. So, JPEG does this", 
    "for images. Mp3. Which is like, it sounds like the definition of being in college. I", 
    "guess not anymore. That&#39;s just being alive anyway so MP3 is very, is aggressively", 
    "lossy. It&#39;s starts with a lot of data and it has all these tricks to throw out and", 
    "cut corners a little bit to get it down to be pretty small. As I mention before MP3", 
    "data works out about one megabyte, about a million bytes per minute at your corporate", 
    "high quality audio. I should mention MP3 was the result. That format is a result of", 
    "a lot of research that they had Test subjects and they would play sounds with", 
    "different compression schemes and really home in on for the human ear and brain", 
    "what are kind of [inaudible] and omissions that can be heard and what are omissions", 
    "that cannot be heard and there was, and a lot of creativity and research went it to", 
    "having MP3 worked pretty well. And that was like I don&#39;t know what to maybe", 
    "fifteen years ago or something? So in fact there have been any advance since then.", 
    "Where they have gotten, the formats have gotten. Even better when they take up less", 
    "space in MP3 but also make their trade offs in more cover release so they even", 
    "sound better than MP3. Alrighty, So, that is, so lossy compression is just like a", 
    "part, part of life."
