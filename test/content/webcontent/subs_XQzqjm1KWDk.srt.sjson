    "So up to now. We&#39;ve looped over data, and written if statements to count one thing", 
    "or another. But really what you want to do is be able to count multiple things. So", 
    "that you can compare them, like are there more boys or girls or whatever they have", 
    "some quality. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do in this section. So in order to do", 
    "this basically what I want to do is just have multiple counter variables. So", 
    "instead of just having count, have a few of them. So let me just show you in this", 
    "code section. So let&#39;s say I wanna go through and I wanna count my goal is do", 
    "more boy or girl names end in Y, like who knows the answer? And well use the", 
    "computer, so what I&#39;m gonna do. Is introduce two count variables. So outside", 
    "the loop, whereas before I just said count equals zero I&#39;m just gonna use the simple", 
    "form of, of calling my variables count1, count2, and so on. Pretty unimaginative,", 
    "but it&#39;s simple. So I&#39;m gonna h, in this case I&#39;m gonna have two variables. So I&#39;ll", 
    "say count1 equals zero and count2 equals zero. And my intention is that, well, in", 
    "count1 I&#39;ll keep track of the boy case, and in count2 I&#39;ll keep track of the girl", 
    "case. So, inside the loop. This looks very much like what we did before. So, I have", 
    "an if task where I&#39;m looking for, rows where the name ends with Y, and the gender", 
    "is boy. And so when that&#39;s true, I&#39;ll bump up count one. So, count one being sort of", 
    "a boy counter. And then I have, following it, I have a very similar if statement,", 
    "that looks for any name ending in Y, but I&#39;m looking for a gender that equals girl.", 
    "And in that case, I&#39;ll bump up count two. So this, so the loop runs, and it&#39;s just", 
    "going to be counting up the girl, it&#39;s, you know, at the same time, it&#39;s counting", 
    "up the boy and girl cases. And then when it gets the end here. I&#39;ll just run it.", 
    "Then it just says boy count colon count one and girl count, count two. So we see", 
    "it turns out more girl name, more girl names end in Y than, than boy names or", 
    "whatever it is. Obviously with this formula you could test any number of", 
    "things. One thi ng I should point out is that, this is gonna be sort of our", 
    "official, class format for how complicated I wanna make things. So, I&#39;ve got the one", 
    "loop. And then I could have, you know, generally just two or three variables. But", 
    "any number of variables, I set them to zero right here. And then for each one, I", 
    "have an if statement. And I wanna point out, the if statements are one after", 
    "another. And, in fact, the order doesn&#39;t really matter. What, what I would point", 
    "is, the if statements are not inside of each other. I&#39;m not gonna do that. That&#39;s", 
    "more complicated. Of the stuff we can do, perfectly interesting work just sticking", 
    "with this form. Alright. So let me just try and natural extension with this, so", 
    "we&#39;ll just go to three variables, I&#39;ll just show you how that works. So, for", 
    "three variables, I&#39;m just gonna stick with my trivial naming convention. Count one,", 
    "count two, count three. So I set these three variables to zero outside the loop.", 
    "And this case, the questions I wanna ask it, or answer, is, do more names end in A", 
    "or I or O? Who knows. So I&#39;ve got the three counters and I&#39;ll use count one to", 
    "count the A case, and count two for the I case, and count three to the O case. So", 
    "here&#39;s the sort of obvious if statement. If name ends with A, and then [inaudible]", 
    "count one equals count one plus one. And then likewise there is an if statement for", 
    "the I case that bumps up count two, and, and if statement for the O case that bumps", 
    "up count three. And here I&#39;ve got these three print statements, outside the loop.", 
    "So these run right the loop has completed so its bumped up all the counters to", 
    "whatever they&#39;re going to be, and then we just print them out. So it&#39;s trapped. Huh.", 
    "[inaudible]. So A. Totally dominates. 377 in or just like, yeah, whatever. Thanks", 
    "for playing. Nice try. Just a little bit stylistic thing I&#39;ll point out here. My", 
    "naming convention here is, I mean it&#39;s. Kind of lame, you know, just one, two,", 
    "three. Another way we could of done this is, in this case we could of called this", 
    "one count A and count I. I li ke this, count A and count I. So, it would be more", 
    "demonic of, of what it was counting. But then it has the disadvantage of whenever", 
    "you copy pasted or switched from one example to another you would have to like", 
    "to remember rename. So, I decided to go with this very trivial simple just one,", 
    "two, three scheme but we could of done something more complicated there. The", 
    "other thing I&#39;ll point out is that it&#39;s, it&#39;s natural to find, to use copy paste", 
    "for these so you kind of get your first case working and then you [inaudible].", 
    "However, you do that there this very natural error where you have to be very", 
    "careful that you&#39;re manipulating the right variable. So that in this &quot;if&quot; statement", 
    "I&#39;m manipulating count one and then in this &quot;if&quot; statement count two and so and", 
    "so. That&#39;s the sort of thing that happening to [inaudible]. Might help with,", 
    "but it&#39;s, that is, no matter what you&#39;re doing it&#39;s a common error. So you just", 
    "have to be a little bit careful about that. Right. So now that we&#39;ve got the", 
    "ability to count multiply things, I wanna, kinda expand our data set a little bit. So", 
    "I did this survey, which actually I didn&#39;t bring up here. Hum, so in Google", 
    "spreadsheets, since it&#39;s all, everything is just intrinsically online, it works", 
    "really well for sharing data and doing easy stuff. Hum, so it has this feature,", 
    "where you can put up a little, sort of, form survey in front of people. So I made", 
    "this trivial survey where I ask gender, and favorite color, and favorite T.V show", 
    "that&#39;s on, and I just sent this out to my class. Hum, and the way it works is every", 
    "time someone&#39;s submitted a set of answers, and this&#39; anonymous. It would go into the", 
    "spreadsheet. And so this is a, Google Dock spreadsheet and what you is there&#39;s, it&#39;s,", 
    "it&#39;s a table. So here&#39;s a column for gender, and here&#39;s a column for color. And", 
    "these are just the answers. And you see is that every time someone types in an answer", 
    "to the survey that just goes in as one row. And so we have data to sort of play", 
    "around with. We have favorite color, favorite TV show, f avorite book, and what", 
    "not. What I found is that it&#39;s easiest to do stuff with color, and sport, and,", 
    "favorite soda drink, &#39;cause there&#39;s enough repetition there. If you look at book,", 
    "there&#39;s, there&#39;s just so many books published that there, you know, most books", 
    "just appear once. Anyway this is interesting data to, look at just to see", 
    "what&#39;s going on with people who are, I guess about twenty years old in 2012. So,", 
    "from Google spreadsheets you can export that data in CSV format I think I", 
    "mentioned that before. It&#39;s a really common interchange format, and I just", 
    "cleaned up the data a little bit so I removed dots. There was a problem where", 
    "people would type in a Dr. Pepper either with a dot after the first R or not so I", 
    "just removed all dots but other than the data just looks like whatever people typed", 
    "in. So with that data we can write do all sorts of interesting problems, so here", 
    "I&#39;ve set some up. So this data is available as survey/2012.csb so we could", 
    "load that into a table. There&#39;s a function I haven&#39;t talked about before the table", 
    "has called convert to lowercase. What that does is it goes through the table and it", 
    "modifies all the text to just be lowercase letters. So, for example if we want to", 
    "count, oh, well how many people have blue as their favorite color. Well there&#39;s this", 
    "problem that did they type, upper case B blue, or lower case, or you know, all", 
    "lowercase or whatever. So by calling this function we just cha-, all the data is now", 
    "gonna be lowercase. So we just don&#39;t have to think about that variation of what", 
    "people typed. So, I&#39;m gonna do that as a simplification here. Alright. So let me", 
    "look at, so there&#39;s some sample problems here, and as usual we&#39;ve got the,", 
    "solutions level so this will, I&#39;ll just try this out. So it says right code to", 
    "print the soda field of each route. So, what this, what I&#39;m gonna do here. I could", 
    "just print the whole row but it, it&#39;s so much data it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.", 
    "But what could be interesting is, suppose you were curious about what people put for", 
    "the soda data. W hat you could say is, get field, and you need to know what the names", 
    "of the fields are. Their printed [inaudible] somewhere up here. Anyway the", 
    "name of the field that the soda drinks answer is, soda. So I&#39;m just gonna print", 
    "those. And I&#39;m not gonna count anything. Now we&#39;ll comment that out. So if I just", 
    "print that, what we get is it just goes through all the rows. And, and remember,", 
    "now, it&#39;s all lower case, and we can just kinda see what&#39;s there. This is maybe a", 
    "good first step if you sorta wanna see, oh, well, what things seems to come up", 
    "[inaudible]? Or just, kind of, if you&#39;re just curious, about TV shows or movies or", 
    "whatever. [inaudible]. This also shows, I guess, ultimately that row.getfield really", 
    "does just return a string. And so, print understands string, so if we just put it", 
    "there, [inaudible]. Alright, so what I&#39;d like to do is, count the favorite sodas.", 
    "So I wanna say, I&#39;m just gonna say Sprite, Dr. Pepper and Coke. Lets count those", 
    "three. So what I&#39;m go to do is following my previous strategy, as I&#39;ll say count", 
    "one equals zero, count two equals zero, and count three equals zero. So my", 
    "intention is that I&#39;ll, you know, I&#39;ll follow, whatever the order is, what I say.", 
    "Sprite, Dr. Pepper and Coke. So what do I wanna say? If row dot get field soda is", 
    "equal to Sprite. And then write, I can just write it in lower case letters,", 
    "&#39;cause I know that it has been changed. So I wanna say, count one is equal to count", 
    "one plus one. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s counting one drink. We&#39;ll just try it. So this is", 
    "count Sprite. Print count one, and I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m gonna get rid of this line.", 
    "I&#39;m, I&#39;m not gonna print all the sodas as we go. Okay, let&#39;s try that one. Okay.", 
    "Sprite eight, that seems to work. So I wanna check it, because then. I&#39;m gonna do", 
    "some merciless copy-paste. So then I&#39;m gonna count doctor pepper. And I&#39;m gonna", 
    "manipulate count two in that case. And I&#39;m gonna count Coke. And I&#39;m gonna play count", 
    "three. So this is the case I was saying, where you have to be careful. Copy base is", 
    "great, but you gotta make sure you&#39;re doing the right thing. &gt;&gt; And here I&#39;ll", 
    "make two copies of this line. So then this is gonna be Dr. Pepper, count two. And", 
    "Coke is count three. I have to say, there was one other cleanup I did in the data.", 
    "[inaudible], ... &gt;&gt; Okay. That looks right. One other is, people spelled Coke.", 
    "Sometimes they write Coca Cola, with a dash, or not, or whatever, so I just", 
    "changed those all to Coke. So. This is a different data set, but this is following", 
    "kind of my earlier example of counting three things. So it should do well. So the", 
    "case I&#39;d like to, the complexity I&#39;d like to work out is, like, well, you know,", 
    "really, if you look at the data, sometimes people would say Coke, and sometimes they", 
    "would say Diet Coke. And sometimes they would say Dr. Pepper, and sometimes they", 
    "would say Diet Dr. Pepper. So how could I get count two, let&#39;s say, to include both.", 
    "I want to include Dr. Pepper and also Diet Dr. Pepper. And the way to make it more", 
    "inclusive there is to use, the or, oops. So I&#39;m going to say, or. Grab this. Just", 
    "us we&#39;ve done before. I&#39;ll say well, so this is doctor pepper, or diet doctor", 
    "pepper. And do the same thing for this. [inaudible] Be on this. So I&#39;m gonna say", 
    "diet sprite. Oops, [inaudible]. Diet Dr. Pepper and here we&#39;ll say or Diet Coke.", 
    "Alright, so without diet it was eight four eight. Assuming this code is correct,", 
    "let&#39;s read it. So we see it was eight four eight. So, then Dr. Pepper [inaudible]. No", 
    "one drinks Diet Sprite in my class, apparently. Or likes it their best. So Dr.", 
    "Pepper, Pepper went up from four to seven. So it about doubled. And actually, Coke", 
    "also about doubled. So I guess that we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve learned something a little bit", 
    "there. That, for those drinks, diet represents about half. So I also obviously", 
    "like this example, &#39;cause now we&#39;re sort of combining multiple techniques. That", 
    "we&#39;re doing the counting, and then we&#39;re doing things like using or, and, or", 
    "whatever on the if test that&#39;s controlling the count inside the loop. Okay, so let me", 
    "try these are kind of, yo u know, non-trivial examples. Let me try another", 
    "one. Let&#39;s try, let&#39;s try another one of the fields. Let&#39;s try the sport field. So", 
    "this is where people there were a bunch of different sports identified, but I&#39;m going", 
    "to look at the sports of Soccer and football were common ones identified. So", 
    "I&#39;ll just use count one and count two. So I&#39;ll say if sport is equal to soccer,", 
    "let&#39;s say that&#39;ll, we&#39;ll do that on count one and otherwise or. Football is the", 
    "other one, so that one we&#39;ll do in count two. So here we&#39;ll say soccer and", 
    "football. And this count three, I&#39;m just gonna stop doing. Okay, so we&#39;re gonna, so", 
    "this should just go through, and count how many times soccer was the sport that was", 
    "named. And how many times football, and then we&#39;ll see if the assumptions work", 
    "out. So you see, we&#39;ve got soccer seven, football twelve. So football&#39;s pretty", 
    "skippingly ahead there. So the last thing we want to try here is well that we also", 
    "have this gender data. So what I wanna do is let&#39;s just take this seven. Number for", 
    "soccer and let&#39;s break it down by gender and so wait when I say I can break it", 
    "down, what I am doing is like let&#39;s have one counter for women playing soccer and", 
    "one counter for men playing soccer. So let&#39;s say count one will be women playing", 
    "soccer. So how do I, what do I do here. And this is gonna be an, an and. So, I", 
    "say, well if it&#39;s row dot, get field gender. And then, you, you, it just, you", 
    "have to know how the data is coded. In this case, the data is coded as female, is", 
    "the word for, used for that. So, count one is gonna be, answers. Where the row is", 
    "also where they said [inaudible] and here I&#39;ll say soccer and male. And so that will", 
    "go into count two. So here I&#39;ll say soccer and female. And then here I&#39;ll say soccer,", 
    "oops, M. Okay. So, let&#39;s try that. So, soccer without looking at gender, it was", 
    "seven. So now if you look at it you&#39;ll see there&#39;s actually this huge generator. So I", 
    "don&#39;t know if maybe there&#39;s just a lot of women&#39;s soccer team. People in my class", 
    "this quarter, or who knows. But a nyway, yeah. So of, of those seven, six, were", 
    "female, and there was, one male who identified soccer as their favorite sport", 
    "[inaudible]. So, this is just another example of using, you know, combining, the", 
    "counting with and, and or. My previous one was or. This one, I used and. So, that&#39;s,", 
    "that&#39;s sort of as complicated as I wanna get with this table data. I think it has a", 
    "nice very kind of realistic feeling that you have a, data set. And then you just,", 
    "the computer rips over it with a little bit of this logic that you write. And then", 
    "eventually just comes up with a couple numbers, that, you know, are gonna help", 
    "you analyze what&#39;s going on. So that&#39;s a very realistic way that computers are", 
    "used, and an excellent format for writing exercises."
