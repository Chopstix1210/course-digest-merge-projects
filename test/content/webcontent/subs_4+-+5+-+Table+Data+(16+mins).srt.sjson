    "In this section, we're gonna look at a new form of data, called a table. And once we", 
    "look at how tables work, then we're gonna play around with code that manipulates", 
    "tables. So it's very similar to the way earlier we did images and then looked at", 
    "the code that manipulates images. The code to work with tables will actually in some", 
    "ways look, similar to the code that worked on images. So my goal is that the real", 
    "patterns that make any sorta code work are gonna start coming through. So, tables are", 
    "a really common way to organize data on the computer. So as a running example for", 
    "this section, I'm gonna use the social security baby names database. So the", 
    "social security administration does retirement benefits and stuff in the US.", 
    "But they also happen to track, every year. What names are given to babies born in", 
    "that year in the US? And so that's gonna be kinda fun data set that we're gonna", 
    "use, So here I've, I've structured this as an example of a table. So, as I was", 
    "saying, table's a way of storing data. It's basically, you can think of it as", 
    "like a rectangle. So the way the table works is that it is first organized into", 
    "fields. So the baby data is organized into four fields and the fields are name, rank,", 
    "gender and year, Look at the other fields as basically as the columns that make this", 
    "thing up, And then the data is stored in what we'll call rows. So here's the first", 
    "row has the data for the name Jacob, so it says the name is Jacob, the rank is one", 
    "for that name and what rank one for this data set is that Jacob is the most popular", 
    "boy name for babies born in 2010. Then we have gender boys in years 2010. So the", 
    "second row has another name. So each name has its own row. So in this case it says", 
    "the name is Isabella, the rank is one. So what that means is Isabella was The most", 
    "popular girl name for babies born in 2010. So, then we see, Ethan has rank two for", 
    "boy names. Sophia has rank two for girls, and so on. So it, the, the table just has", 
    "all the names. In this case there, they're shown, sorted by rank. So there's o ne row", 
    "per name. In this case it has the 1,000 top boy names and the 1,000 top girl", 
    "names. So, it's, there's 2,000 rows overall. So as I was saying, tables are", 
    "really common for storing all sorts of data on the computer. You may have heard", 
    "the term database. So, a database is a related concept to this, sort of simple,", 
    "basic idea of a table. Generally the way this works is that the fields are, are, or", 
    "you can think of them as the categories, the number of fields is not very big.", 
    "Fields, and there might be eight or ten or something. So they represent kinda the", 
    "fixed categories we wanna keep track of. And then the number of rows could be", 
    "enormous. It might be millions or maybe even billions of rows. So I'll just,", 
    "mention a couple examples. So you could think of your, your email inbox is maybe", 
    "stored in a table on the computer. So the way that would work is, well, what would", 
    "the fields be? The fields might be something like from, and to, and date, and", 
    "subject, and, you know, a few other things that you store, per message. And then one", 
    "row is just one message. So each message gets its own row, and then we have this,", 
    "fixed number of fields. So then when you go to your inbox, well, there might be.", 
    "10,000 rows in there for all your email and maybe when you go to your inbox it", 
    "just selects the ten most recent ones and shows you, maybe not all the fields, but", 
    "maybe the most important fields from that message. Another example is Craig's List.", 
    "Or, you know, any sorta online auction site. Where maybe it's stored, it could be", 
    "stored in a table where one row is gonna be one item for sale. And then the fields", 
    "would again be sorta the categories that you want for one item. So the categories,", 
    "the fields might be the price, the date it was listed. Maybe a short description, and", 
    "a long description, and a few things like that. So those are just a couple examples", 
    "of how many of the things you deal with day to day often, back on the computer,", 
    "that's gonna be stored in some kinda table. Alright, so to make this real, I", 
    "wanna look at co de to manipulate, tables. And I'm gonna use the baby name table as", 
    "sort of our, our working example for a, a couple sections here. So, in this case,", 
    "the baby data for 2010 is stored in, baby-2010.csv. I should just mention, CSV", 
    "stands for Comma Separated Values. It's a standard for storing, essentially table", 
    "data in a text file, and it's a really simple, fairly old standard. So it's a", 
    "pretty, you know, easy way to interchange data from one program to another. So in", 
    "terms of the code, I'll make my analogy to images. So for images, we had four pixel", 
    "colon images, And that would loop through all the pixels in the image, and for each", 
    "pixel. Everyone, whatever this code was inside the colon braces. So, for the table", 
    "to be very similar we're going to have four row colon table, And what that's", 
    "going to do is it's just going to loop through each row through the table. So, it", 
    "just starts from the top and go through each one. And for each row it's going to", 
    "run whatever code I put in the colon braces. So, here is our first example.", 
    "That is the line, very similar to, loading an image. So that's the line that, grabs", 
    "the table and stores it in a variable, which I will inevitably just call the", 
    "table, And then here I have the four loop, sorta looking through all the rows. And in", 
    "this case, the simplest thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say, print row. So, I'm", 
    "just gonna, essentially just, you know, look at a, print each row in the data. So", 
    "this is the baby data, so if I run this. There is row one and row two and so on, So", 
    "you can see that Jacob, Isabel, Ethan, those fairly popular names. It actually", 
    "made my web page quite tall because of course there is two thousand of these", 
    "things. So you know there's Courtney with a K The 637 popular girl names. So it runs", 
    "all the way down here as I was saying. Oops, to a, to a thousand. So Acre and an", 
    "Danea, So That is one thing, so what, I guess what this shows, sort of, a bulk", 
    "output thing, but what it shows is, that line ran 2,000 times. Once for each row in", 
    "the table. So, just as with the image, the four loop just went through and looked at", 
    "each one. Alright so here I'm gonna comma this out and run again just to get rid of", 
    "the output so I can have my webpage and I'll be a mile high here. So what are we", 
    "gonna do with the table? Just looping through and printing each row, that's like", 
    "[laugh], like for Craigslist or for your email. That's never what you want. What we", 
    "want is to loop through all the rows and just pick out the six or two of the 2,000", 
    "that we want. This is very common thing to do with table [inaudible]. It is sometimes", 
    "called in database terminology a quarry. That I'm going to kind of sort of narrow", 
    "down to just the rows I want. So, let's talk about the code to do that. So", 
    "[inaudible] we're going to do this with an IF statement, Put an IF statement inside", 
    "the loop and in the IF task we will write a task to select just some of the rows. So", 
    "here's gonna be my first example. So here is the four loop. So that's looping", 
    "through all the rows. And then inside the four loop, I've got this if statement. So", 
    "what's gonna happen is, this highlighted code is gonna run again and again and", 
    "again, once for each row in the thing. And so what I've done. So I've, written a test", 
    "here, and my, the goal here is, in this case, is to just pick out the rows where", 
    "the rank is six. And so, let me talk about how that works. So what's gonna happen is", 
    "that highlighted test, that test is gonna be evaluated once for every row. So in a", 
    "sense 2000 times. So, what I'm gonna do is structure the test so it's true for a row", 
    "I care about. And then inside of here I'll put a print, so it'll print the ones I", 
    "care about. In all the other rows this will be false, and so it won't print the,", 
    "won't print those. All right, so how does this work? So just as for the pixel, we", 
    "had get red and get green and get blue the row has get field. And so you could,", 
    "remember we called it a row because all the way across it has a bunch of different", 
    "fields. So you can say, well, which field do you want? The way this works is each", 
    "field has a n ame. In this case, the names are name, rank, gender and year. So in", 
    "this case, I say get field. And then, within the parentheses, I say in a string,", 
    "which field do I want by name? So in this case, I'm, like, oh right. I wanna go to", 
    "the row, and I wanna pick out the rank. So this highlighted part that goes to the", 
    "row. And that picks out the rank. Just as before we would have a pixel dot get red", 
    "and that would pick, that would pull the red just out of the pixel, so this is", 
    "analogous but for a table. So now my call here for this example is I wanted to just", 
    "show what the rows where the rank [inaudible] required new little bit of", 
    "code. So having picked the rank out here, then I says equals, equals, which I think", 
    "we already used before, but two equal signs next to each other that compares two", 
    "things for equality, it tested they are the same. And so road get field rank", 
    "equal, equal six. What that says is, get the rank out, and test if it's six. And if", 
    "it's six, we'll say that that's, the test is true. And if it's not, we'll say it's", 
    "false. So, let me just try running this. So if I run it, what's happened is, it", 
    "went through all 2,000 rows. And for these two rows, that test was true, Because", 
    "that's the case where the, the rank was six. And obviously, you know, I could say", 
    "it, like, 127 here or whatever. And then we would get the two rows. It just", 
    "happens; each rank number has one boy name and one girl name in the Stata set. So,", 
    "that's why I keep getting two rows here. So let me try another example. Oh, also I", 
    "should mention a, a warning about this. So I'll change this back to six, quick. So", 
    "this use of the two equals for equality is a little odd in computer code. I think it", 
    "would be very reasonable to think, oh, what, shouldn't there be just one equal", 
    "sign? Right? If rank equals six? And unfortunately the single equal sign in", 
    "JavaScript already has been used for variable assignment. It's kinda already", 
    "dedicated to meaning that. And so they couldn't use it for quality, so that's why", 
    "there's this different symbol for equa lity. Now, just for this class. So the,", 
    "it's actually a pretty common error coding to sort of accidentally type a single", 
    "equal sign, when someone meant two equal signs for comparison. In this case. I've", 
    "outfitted the run button with some special checking code, where it notices if in an", 
    "if test, it sees a single equal sign, And it gives this error message that basically", 
    "says, hey, did, did you maybe mean to use, two equal signs? So, that is an easy error", 
    "to make, but. Hit the run button and we'll catch it for you. That, that's something I", 
    "just did for this class, Alright so now let me do a now let me do another example.", 
    "So the test I did before I tested if rank was six but really any kind of test as we", 
    "were doing before with images, will work here. So in this case what I'm going to do", 
    "is I want to go through the data set and I want to find the data, let's just say, for", 
    "Alice. So as I mentioned before forget field you can just patch in the name for", 
    "any field. So, you would need to know what the field names are. For this data set", 
    "they are name ranked under here and here. So, here I will go to the row and say, hey", 
    "give me the name field. So I'll say, name there. And then I'll, I'll equals, equals,", 
    "test if the name is, is the same as Alice. So, if I run that. In effect what this", 
    "does is it just pulls out the Alice row. It goes through all the rows, does this", 
    "test, and if the name is Alice, let's hear the English translation of this, then it", 
    "prints the row out. Alright, so that's the basic pattern. So let me just work a few", 
    "examples for this. So, the pattern is gonna be, [inaudible] just as I was doing.", 
    "We have a four loop, there's an if statement side of it. And then really, all", 
    "of the action is in the parentheses of the test. Where I say row.getfield something,", 
    "and I have some test about it. So let's try these. So if I run it this way, we", 
    "pull out, it says, if name is equal, equal to Alice, I get the Alice row. If I wanted", 
    "to look for something else, pull out some other data, we could say Robert. So Alice", 
    "is 172. Ro bert is 54. Let's try Abby. 284. So, what's happening is, this", 
    "highlighted test is happening all 2000 times. And it's just a question of which", 
    "rows are we, are we picking out there? I did Robert before. I'll show you something", 
    "kind of funny. If you do Bob and you run. Nothing appears here. What's going on", 
    "there is actually no one names their kid Bob. Apparently, so what's happening is", 
    "that we are getting no... Zero printing is happening here. This thing was just never", 
    "true. That's sort of the pattern on the form I guess for just as how people name", 
    "babies is that they tend of the form... They put a long name, like Robert. So, and", 
    "then Bob is like, they don't put on the form. Maybe that's just what they actually", 
    "call the kid. Alright, so let me try a different test. Let's say I wanna test if", 
    "the rank is one. So I would change get field, and I would type rank here. And", 
    "then the equals, equals. I can say one, sure. So that gives me the two rows Jacob", 
    "and Isabelle. We saw four, those are rank one. So. [inaudible], what was the other", 
    "one we did 1,000. So say rank equals a thousand. And we get crew ending. So the", 
    "test we did earlier with images like less than, less than equal to. All that stuff", 
    "works too. So let's say I wanna look at, if the rank is less than ten. [inaudible]", 
    "say less than ten and when I run that. You can see I get, rank one, rank two, rank", 
    "three, rank... All these are rank numbers where the less than ten test is true.", 
    "Although you'll notice the last I get is Aiden and Cloe, number nine. The rows", 
    "where rank is ten, I don't get. And that's because this form of less than is a strict", 
    "less than. So it's true for nine but it's not true for ten. If you want, there's", 
    "another form of less than where you're like, where you wanna say less than or", 
    "equal to. And, I don't think we did this for the images but it's just, what you do", 
    "is you put in an equal sign right after it. That means less than or equal to. So", 
    "if I run it now then it goes through ten. So, and that works for, greater than as", 
    "well. Alright, so let's try a, let's try a greater than one. So I could say, I would", 
    "like to see all the rows where the rank is greater than 990, let's say. And so what", 
    "I, so I get 991, 92, da, da, da, da, up through 1000. Okay, let me just try one", 
    "more. I, so [inaudible] examples with name and rank. And [inaudible] inevitably, I'm", 
    "calling, road.getfield, and just changing what string is there to pull out a", 
    "different field. I'll try pulling out the, the gender field. And this case, the way", 
    "the data's coded, the gender field is it's, it's, it's just strings. So it's", 
    "either the string boy or string girl. So if I were to say, if gender is equal,", 
    "equal to girl. Hit one then I get [sound] I mean if you look where it say scroll", 
    "here, what's happened is I have just gotten all 1,000 girl bros. And, and none", 
    "of the 1000 [inaudible] woops. Alrighty. Sorry, let me get this back. So this is", 
    "ju-, just a trick where I comment out print, so it prints nothing, and run it", 
    "again. So then, that way, it just, it just blanks out the output here. So. Just to", 
    "repeat what the pattern is. So, t, t, these first few lines were always the", 
    "same. And I guess I was always [inaudible] the row. So the, that was always the same.", 
    "What I change is the if test. And the gist of it, the pattern tended to be I would", 
    "say row.getField, whatever field I care about. And then I would write equals,", 
    "equals or less than or equal to or something. Let's say on the rank or equal,", 
    "equal to the name to, in a sense, pull out the rows. And the rule was, I'm pulling", 
    "out a row, if this test is true. And so, with that in mind, well this can be a good", 
    "source of some exercises."
