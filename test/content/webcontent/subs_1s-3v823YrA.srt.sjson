    "In this section, I&#39;m going to talk about how computer networks work. So computer", 
    "networks are kinda like a phone system for computers. Where any computer can place", 
    "like a data call to any other computer. Now, the basic outlines of how it works", 
    "are surprisingly simple. Although the details are fairly complicated. But, I", 
    "figure, just making up a statistic, I expect most Stanford students are doing,", 
    "are using a computer network within ten minutes of waking up in the morning, and", 
    "probably within ten minutes of falling asleep at night. So, I figure, like, well", 
    "it&#39;s kinda like, worth knowing. So I&#39;ll start at the small scale. A LAN, it stands", 
    "for a Local Area Network. These are very common. A LAN is a network that would be", 
    "used to cover maybe one floor of a building or maybe just within a house or", 
    "something like that. So I&#39;ll talk about that case first. And then in the next", 
    "section I&#39;ll talk about how that scales up to cover the entire earth, with the, the", 
    "Internet. So, two very common examples of LAN technology are Ethernet. Which is", 
    "wired, uses wires, it&#39;s wired land technology, and Wi-Fi, which is the", 
    "wireless radio sort of analog to Ethernet. Those are both incredibly common", 
    "so those are worth seeing. So let&#39;s talk about Ethernet", 
    "first. So the way wired Ethernet works is it uses these wires that are maybe about", 
    "the size of a soda straw. Here&#39;s a picture of one. And they terminate in these jacks", 
    "that&#39;s called an RJ-45 jack, which is a little bit bigger than a phone jack. And", 
    "here you can see the wires going into it, and the wires are, a lot of times they&#39;re", 
    "blue or yellow. And Ethernet is good for about 100 meters maximum length. So you", 
    "can see that&#39;s how it sorta covers, you know, basically one building or, or one", 
    "floor or something like that. Here&#39;s a picture of a wireless router. But just so", 
    "you can see, the two Ethernet cables going into the back. And so if you&#39;ve got any", 
    "piece of, you know, a computer or something that you&#39;re going to use", 
    "Ethernet with. You know, yeah, it&#39;s gonna have this kind of plug in the back and at", 
    "so me point you end up plugging this piece in that jack, Ethernet jack in there. So", 
    "that&#39;s, that&#39;s what that is. So what I wanna talk, figure is, well if you have", 
    "these wires how is it the data gets from one place to another? So the case I wanna", 
    "consider is, let&#39;s say, you know, here at computer one I&#39;ve got flowers.jpeg. Just a", 
    "file with a lot of, a lot of bits in it. And I wanna think about well how does that", 
    "get, how would I send that over the Ethernet cable over to computer two? So", 
    "the way that works, the way all networking is done. Is that if you&#39;ve got a", 
    "relatively large file, the way the networking lair is going to deal with", 
    "stuff is to break the data into what are called packets. And so each packet is", 
    "relatively small. Packet might be 1000 bytes, or it might be 1500 bytes. So", 
    "let&#39;s, I&#39;ll use 1500 bytes. It&#39;s a common size for my running example here. So when", 
    "computer one wants to send this image, really what it&#39;s gonna do is take the", 
    "image, all those bytes, you know, 50,000 bytes or whatever it is, and break it into", 
    "a series of packets where each packet is only 1,500 bytes and so all we have to", 
    "think about is well how do you send one packet on the wire. And then you can see", 
    "it sorta scales up, you know, you just sorta send all the packets. So I wanna", 
    "look at the case very specifically of the ether net sending one packet. So let&#39;s I&#39;m", 
    "gonna start on the right hand side here of my drawing. So let&#39;s say I&#39;ve got a, you", 
    "know, I. Computer one and you, you&#39;ve got this packet. And if we were to look inside", 
    "of it, basically it&#39;s a series of bytes, where each byte is a series of eight", 
    "zeroes and ones. So, the way this is gonna work. Is that the sending computer, the", 
    "way you can think of it, is it just reads through the, the first byte here. And", 
    "there&#39;s just a pattern of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. And so it&#39;s just going to follow a scheme.", 
    "Say, alright, let&#39;s say that for each one, we&#39;ll call that three vaults. And so I&#39;ll", 
    "put three volts on the wire. And every time there&#39;s a zero I&#39;ll put zero volts on", 
    "the wire and so just kind o f reads through. You don&#39;t have to understand in", 
    "electricity to follow along, but it just reads through and puts a pattern of 1&#39;s", 
    "and 0&#39;s on the wire. And also to hand wave a little bit it turns, turns out the wire,", 
    "that pattern of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s travels along the wire here. It&#39;ll make most sense if", 
    "you just look at the left hand side. And just imagine the receiver, is just looking", 
    "at the wire. And what the receiver is gonna see, is a series of voltages. So the", 
    "first thing the receiver sees is oh three volts hm, okay I guess that&#39;s a one. And", 
    "then the next thing that comes is like a pipe hm, the electrons are coming out. The", 
    "next thing it sees is a zero. Oh okay I guess that was zero volts. And then", 
    "there&#39;s three volts. Oh I guess that was a one. Oh it&#39;s still at three volts so I", 
    "guess that&#39;s another one. And a zero and so on. So the receiver. You can think of", 
    "just observing this pattern of three volts and zero volts coming down the wire. Of", 
    "course, it happens very, very quickly. And from just observing the pattern of three", 
    "volts and zero volts is able to sort of recover. Of what the original bite was.", 
    "And so, ultimately that&#39;s, that&#39;s how the entire packet is sent. The sender just", 
    "reads through all the bits, and sends a pattern of voltage. And the receiver,", 
    "basically you know reconstructs all 1500, 1500 bites to get the packet back. So,", 
    "that&#39;s actually how it works. That&#39;s how it is. You can have data, on one computer", 
    "and they&#39;re connected with an Ethernet cable and somehow it like sends all the", 
    "ones and zeros over that wire. So, an actual question. Is, well what about", 
    "errors? So for modern Ethernet, the transmission happens at a rate of one", 
    "billion bits per second. A billion ones and zeroes per second on that wire, so", 
    "very quickly. And it&#39;s easy to imagine. Yeah, sure. Every now and then there&#39;s", 
    "gonna be an error. A one, for some reason, comes through as a zero or something like", 
    "that. So I wanna talk about this technique called check sums that are, well, just", 
    "kinda interesting to see and are really used to detect and correct errors. So, the", 
    "way it works is, look at, I&#39;ll look at my little diagram down here. Is the sender,", 
    "before they send the packet they, you know, they can look at the whole packet", 
    "and it&#39;s just a bunch of numbers. Right? A bunch of bytes between zero and 255 as we", 
    "know. And so what the sender can do is go through these numbers and just add them", 
    "up. So in this case these add to 491. And the sender will say, let&#39;s see, you know,", 
    "we&#39;ll just choose an example. Let&#39;s say our scheme is we just always take the last", 
    "two digits. So in this case the last two digits are 91. And we&#39;ll say, that&#39;s the", 
    "check sum for this packet and we&#39;ll just put that on the end and send that too. So", 
    "the way this works is that obviously the receiver, gets all the. Gets the whole", 
    "packet and the receive, r can just do the same addition. So the receiver adds up all", 
    "the bites that they got. And they see oh did they get 91 two? Do, do the check-ons", 
    "match? If the checks-ons don&#39;t match then that suggests well. Some bit in there got", 
    "flipped. There, there was some error. Something didn&#39;t come through quite right.", 
    "And so what, what the receiver can do, is just ask the sender to re-send that", 
    "packet. Each packet is relatively small so this is not, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not a big problem.", 
    "And so the result is, basically, this provides a little guarantee that each", 
    "packet came through correctly. And so by requesting that the one is re-sent the", 
    "receiver can eventually end up with a perfect set of packets, and sort of", 
    "having, having checked each one. So this scheme is used, actually not just in", 
    "networking, but in many layers of computer systems. There&#39;s this notion of having to", 
    "check something that accompanies the data to sort of make sure that each, each", 
    "transfer went through correctly. So that&#39;s how it is that you can have, some", 
    "large.jpeg file on your computer and put it on a thumb drive and then later send it", 
    "over the network. And somehow even though you&#39;re sending it from place to place, it", 
    "keeps coming through, really a 100 % correct right? Each zero and one is", 
    "exactly what it&#39;s supposed to be and checks on just a little bit what&#39;s going", 
    "on behind that network. One thing I should mention is that this check sum", 
    "scheme - well, so, first of all, the scheme I", 
    "described here is just adding it up - the real check sum scheme that&#39;s used is a", 
    "little more complicated than that. But it is possible", 
    "that you can have two errors that sort of cancel out just so, so there&#39;s an error,", 
    "but the check sum scheme doesn&#39;t detect it. That&#39;s possible, although it is a, it", 
    "is a microscopic possibility. But it is, this is not a completely foolproof scheme.", 
    "So I want to scale this up a little bit. Thus far I&#39;ve talked about just", 
    "essentially having two computers with an Ethernet cable and talk about, also, how", 
    "does Ethernet scale up to having a bunch of computers all talking to one wire? This", 
    "is I think a, a nice design to see. It&#39;s a very elegant design. And patterns that you", 
    "see in this design will reappear in. It&#39;s such a successful design that has been", 
    "kinda used for solve a lot of problems. So let me just set up the, the problem here.", 
    "Look at this picture at the bottom. So the way Ethernet works is that you could have", 
    "a bunch of computers. So here I&#39;ve drawn four computers, and there&#39;s just one wire.", 
    "Here the sort of backbone, and they&#39;re all sharing it. So the Ethernet design is all", 
    "about having one share piece of hardware and a bunch of computers using it and", 
    "they&#39;re able to cooperate to use that shared bit of hardware, efficiently. So I", 
    "want to talk about how it is that one computer would send a packet to another", 
    "computer. On Ethernet, and it&#39;s setup like this where I have a bunch of computers all", 
    "sharing the wire. So the analogy is always that it, it&#39;s kind of like at a cocktail", 
    "party. That if you have a bunch of people all sort of facing each other, they&#39;re", 
    "able to have a conversation, even though two people can&#39;t really talk at the same", 
    "time, but they&#39;re able to sort of cooperate and take turns, basically. And", 
    "Ethernet works in a way similar to that. So here&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna work. Each one", 
    "of these computers has a, an address, a unique address I would say, you know,", 
    "computers one, two, three, four. And when a computer wants to send a packet. So here", 
    "I&#39;ve drawn on the left here, a packet. The com, the packet will begin with a, a two", 
    "colon field. It&#39;ll say what is the destination computer for this? So let&#39;s", 
    "say in this case that computer one wants to send a packet over here to computer", 
    "four. So computer one will get the packet ready. And then what computer one will do", 
    "is wait for a period of silence, on the wire. So maybe computers two and three", 
    "were having some conversation. So the wire was kinda busy, carrying that traffic. But", 
    "eventually the wire goes, quiet. And so when computer one here&#39;s a period of", 
    "silence. Then computer one puts the package on the wire. Sends it out there.", 
    "And. Naively you sort of think oh looks like. Oh you know the package sort of goes", 
    "down here and turns right goes to computer four. But really it&#39;s more like a", 
    "broadcast. The signal of that package just spreads out on the wire and it just", 
    "spreads out, to every corner of the wire. So it&#39;s really a broadcast. It just", 
    "occupies the entire wire. Now, the way it works in Internet is that every computer,", 
    "is listening to the wire all the time. Everybody listens to the wire. And what", 
    "they&#39;re doing is really they&#39;re just listening for packets addressed to them.", 
    "So when this packet addressed to computer four goes out, computer four will hear it", 
    "and say, oh hey, that one&#39;s for me. And so copy down the zeros and ones for that", 
    "packet and like okay, that&#39;s one for computer four. And computer three and", 
    "computer two will also see the zeros and ones go, going by. But they&#39;ll, they&#39;ll", 
    "just notice, oh hey, to: computer four. Okay, that one&#39;s not for me. And so they", 
    "can just disregard it. So that, that&#39;s how it works. The so the interesting case for", 
    "sharing with Ethernet is. What if, computer one, as I discovered before, is", 
    "gonna send a packet to computer four. But it happens that computer three. Also had a", 
    "packet to send. And if the, you kn ow, if you&#39;re just unlucky, it&#39;s possible that", 
    "both computer one and computer three will hear the same period of silence. And so", 
    "they will both decide to start, start sending on our one shared wire. And so", 
    "what will happen is, the wire can&#39;t carry multiple conversations at once. And so if", 
    "they both start transmitting, there&#39;s said to be a collision, where the two", 
    "conversations kinda overlap and they override each other. And it eventually", 
    "just becomes hopelessly garbled. So, neither, both packets are basically", 
    "destroyed and useless by this property, by this collision. So what happens is,", 
    "ideally computer one and computer three eventually notice that someone else is", 
    "talking over them, and so they can at least stop transmitting. And so the wire", 
    "gets back to being. Quiet. And so both computer one and computer three, we", 
    "realize, okay well, that didn&#39;t work. So. If they both just heard the silence and", 
    "just started transmitting again, well it would just collide again. And so this is", 
    "a, a clever part, a very clever part of the Ethernet. Which is, well how to, how", 
    "to get them essentially to take turns. Right? To get one to transmit and the", 
    "other one to wait. So the way this works is that, both computer one and computer", 
    "three in Ethernet wait a random amount of time. They just make a random number and", 
    "say, I&#39;m gonna wait that long, and then I&#39;m gonna, then I&#39;ll try and transmit. And", 
    "so in effect, it&#39;s kind of fair, in effect, one of them will end up going", 
    "first, the wire won&#39;t be quiet anymore cause it&#39;s carrying that conversation and", 
    "so we can just go back to our regular strategy. So that enables that when you", 
    "get a collision, essentially they both sort of back off and then one of them is", 
    "able to take turns, so eventually you&#39;re able to use the wire pretty, pretty", 
    "efficiently. So, that&#39;s, that&#39;s how you have a, a bunch of computers all connected", 
    "to just this one Ethernet wire. And they&#39;re able to, to use it, use it pretty", 
    "efficiently. Now probably most of the people watching this aren&#39;t maybe using", 
    "wired Ethernet anymore . That almost seems a little bit old. The very common way to", 
    "connect to any kind of network now is Wi-Fi. And I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;m going to talk", 
    "about Wi-Fi very little it&#39;s really the same strategy. So, the hallmark of", 
    "Ethernet is that you had this shared wire. And only one person really can transmit at", 
    "a time. And you want to kind of somehow collectively share it. Wi-fi is exactly", 
    "the same. In this case instead of a wire what you have is a radio channel. So", 
    "there&#39;s some Radio Channel that&#39;s been used right? So we got all these computers.", 
    "They have little radios on them that drawing these kind of lame, radio", 
    "transmitting marks on here. So there&#39;s some Radio Channel. They&#39;re all sharing", 
    "it, and then it looks very much like the Internet. So they&#39;re gonna have a strategy", 
    "of waiting for a period of silence. And when there&#39;s silence broadcasting. All the", 
    "computers listen all the time. Watching out for packets addressed to them and", 
    "ignoring packets that are not addressed to them. And sometimes you&#39;ll have a", 
    "collision. Two people start transmitting at the same time. You wanna sort of notice", 
    "that and then have some random back-off strategy so that you can, you can wait for", 
    "silence again and transmit without overlapping. So, it just happens, very", 
    "similar strategy works. So just to kind of to summarize as I was saying, some of the", 
    "qualities that go into Ethernet&#39;s design. Re-occur in other. In sort of larger", 
    "problems. It&#39;s just a, a fundamentally bunch of good decisions. And so I think", 
    "it&#39;s, it&#39;s worth seeing for that reason. So the set up is that you&#39;ve got the wire", 
    "the radiowave or whatever - some shared resource - and", 
    "you want to you wanna use it efficiently. And the solution is not gonna have,", 
    "involve essential authority. Instead, all the actors are gonna have a distributed", 
    "and collaborative strategy. So they&#39;re, they&#39;re able to cooperate with each other", 
    "collectively to use the thing efficiently. Another quality, which I. Which I&#39;ll point", 
    "out now which I didn&#39;t point out then is. This is very insecure. Remember what it", 
    "looked like when computer one was sending a packet to computer four? Well that", 
    "packet kind of went to computer three too. Right? If computer three wanted to listen", 
    "in they could. And this really gets back to the notion of, well what does shared", 
    "mean. Shared in this case means when anybody broadcasts anybody else can", 
    "listen. Not anybody else on earth, but anybody else. You know, within a hundred", 
    "meters sort of on, on that same local area network then that is certainly true. Now", 
    "this doesn&#39;t mean that all security on the Internet is hopeless, it just means that", 
    "there&#39;s another layer of encryption and security that we would wanna add. That the", 
    "LAN itself is not secure. So I&#39;ll talk about that more when I talk, you know,", 
    "in a later security section. Another quality of this is that, because", 
    "you&#39;ve got this one medium that you&#39;re sharing, it means that as more and more", 
    "computers are using it, the performance available to any one computer kind of", 
    "degrades. Then again, this just gets back to sharing. Right? Well, if computers two", 
    "and three are tying up the wireless zone, you know, sending some big file or", 
    "something, well that means that there&#39;s going to be less silence. And so computer", 
    "one will sort of get less, have less, less, fewer bytes that they&#39;re able to", 
    "send. That&#39;s not - it can be a good quality, but what you want is that the", 
    "performance sort of degrades. You get less capacity but it doesn&#39;t just break out", 
    "right. And so ethernet definitely has that quality, of degrading. So as I said this", 
    "is, it&#39;s a very popular very successful set of design choices. And so we&#39;ll see,", 
    "see that kinda thing later on."
