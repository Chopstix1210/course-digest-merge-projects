    "simplest case and the running example I&#39;m gonna use today is sound. So, What does", 
    "sound look like, how does sound work? You know the sound of my voice or music or", 
    "something. So, sound is actually just pressure waves in the air, just little", 
    "minute increases or decreases in pressure. And inevitably it&#39;s described as traveling", 
    "up through the air like if you threw a pebble in a pond and you sort of saw the", 
    "waves traveling out. So here is my, my made up example of what a sound wave might", 
    "look like. It turns out many of the sounds that are used in day to day life do have", 
    "this kind of repetitive pattern. And so that&#39;ll, that&#39;ll come up. So oh here&#39;s a,", 
    "here&#39;s a slightly better example. So how does a violin work? [laugh] No expenses", 
    "been spared on this artwork. Yeah question. Oh, I&#39;m sorry, yeah, I, I", 
    "haven&#39;t put this on the web page yet. I will after class. But there is a. Please.", 
    "Sorry. So, a violin you know, a violin is a musical instrument you can play it. But,", 
    "how does that work? Well the way the violin works is that there is these", 
    "strings and they are attached to this hollow wooden body And as the bow is drawn", 
    "across the strings. You know, they&#39;re metal and they&#39;re under tension. And they,", 
    "they vibrate as some, at, at a repeating, at sort of a repeating frequency. And", 
    "really the gist of it is that it; it vibrates the wood of the violin. And so", 
    "the wood will flex out a little bit and flex in a little bit. And so, it&#39;s sort of", 
    "like a drum where you can kind of think of it as kind of bumping up and down. And", 
    "what that does is it creates little pressure waves in the air. And so, those", 
    "travel out in all directions And event. So, so, there&#39;s the signal in the violin.", 
    "I&#39;m drawing it like this little wave. You know what&#39;s going on? Half a millimeter up", 
    "and a half a millimeter down And then that translates into the air where it&#39;s going", 
    "out as these little pressure waves. And the thing about analog is that the shapes", 
    "are the same. So that on the violin if it kind of a little down a [inaudible] you", 
    "know where, and we could have sounds with different sharpness&#39;s and different", 
    "frequencies and a, that, that is reproduced in the air basically. So it&#39;s", 
    "travelling out in the air and eventually gets to your, you know, your [inaudible].", 
    "And you&#39;re listening and in your ear there&#39;s the little eardrum, right, which", 
    "is very much like a, a drum head and the air pushes against it and so it pushes it", 
    "in a little bit, out a little bit. So that. I mean partly it&#39;s just my low", 
    "quality explanation of how violin sound works. But also that&#39;s very, analog. That", 
    "you have something on the violin but [inaudible] it would, then it translates", 
    "to some sort of other medium in the air, but you sorta keep the shape, it travels", 
    "in the air for a while and starts to get to your ear drum, and again in the ear", 
    "drum the shape is preserved. That is the fundamental quality of analog processes;", 
    "you&#39;re sorta jumping from step to step but keeping the shape. So to show you how this", 
    "works, we&#39;ll do some demos and experiments and stuff. I&#39;m gonna use a device called", 
    "an oscilloscope. A sure sign that your, that nerds are near is if there&#39;s an", 
    "oscilloscope. Oscilloscopes are, are really neat in my, you know, in my", 
    "opinion. Really neat device and it, it very much gets this idea of analog. What", 
    "an oscilloscope does is it takes in electricity on a pair of wires. And it", 
    "just looks at the wires, and it observes the, the signal of voltage kinda going up", 
    "or down over time. It looks at that signal. And it reproduces it on screen so", 
    "you can&#39;t, something which is very abstract right I, I gesture my hands and I", 
    "say well there&#39;s the sand coming out of the violin but it&#39;s all just hand waving.", 
    "This [inaudible] scope makes it real it takes a signal out of the wire and it", 
    "draws it makes us visualize, I think we&#39;re very visual creatures and so [inaudible]", 
    "kind of amazing you know very handy. This things had been around for actually a long", 
    "time since I think the 1930&#39;s and the one I&#39;m going to use today When I switch this", 
    "screen here. [cough] [sound] This is actually a, a digital oscilloscope hooked", 
    "up to my computer just cause it makes it easy to display stuff. But it is at the", 
    "end of the day an oscilloscope. So this is the oscilloscope out-scope, output right", 
    "now what its showing is nothing. Oh actually I&#39;m sorry let me switch back and", 
    "explain a little bit more how this works. So the way the oscilloscope works is it", 
    "grabs the signal off the wire and it, it draws it. And, the way the [inaudible]", 
    "works is that it leaves the signal up there for maybe a tenth of a second. It", 
    "freezes it. And then it grabs another signal off your hearing. And it puts that", 
    "one up. So, it doesn&#39;t quite track what&#39;s on the wire in real time. There&#39;s maybe a", 
    "half second delay because that&#39;s the way this one works. So what I&#39;ve got for my", 
    "demo here is I&#39;ve got this. And as will become obvious, I&#39;m no musician. But I, I", 
    "have this synthesizer hooked up. And so the synthesizer is hooked up to the", 
    "speakers, so I can make sounds and kind of play around with them, but it&#39;s also", 
    "hooked up to the [inaudible] scope. So what it is what it&#39;s like two of the five", 
    "senses. Right? So, you can hear it, but you can also see it. And so then we can", 
    "talk about what is a wave, what is a signal? Alrighty [inaudible]. This is", 
    "where they complicated demo. This is where I guess I need to appeal to the demo gods", 
    "for my complicated set up here. Let&#39;s slide this over so I can actually reach", 
    "it. Alright y, so let&#39;s try this. So my first claim, or I&#39;ll just start, try", 
    "making a sound here. Here we go. So this is a, a, a [inaudible] math class, this is", 
    "a sine wave. And a sign wave, right this sort of perfect mathematical wave has this", 
    "kind of boring, perfect bell like sound. And so, that&#39;s the. That is the", 
    "electricity coming off the synthesizer which is driving the speakers and it&#39;s", 
    "also making that thing. So let me try, so what I wanna do just first off is just", 
    "talk about what are the properties of a signal like that. I&#39;m sometimes I&#39;ll use", 
    "the word signal, that&#39;s kind of the term for this sort of. Data that I want to play", 
    "around with. Or I might use the word wave, er [inaudible] but really what I&#39;m talking", 
    "about here is signals. So, the, I&#39;m going to talk about some of the qualities that", 
    "signals have the first quality I&#39;ll talk about is er, frequency. So this one, this", 
    "is kind of a low note. And so, remember what I said, with the oscilloscope is that", 
    "it grabs a wave and then it shows it to you again maybe a hundredth of a second", 
    "later or whatever, maybe a tenth of a second later. So those variations in", 
    "pressure, that&#39;s actually maybe a hundred per second, something like that, and we&#39;re", 
    "just seeing it very zoomed in, so the width of the screen in this case I think", 
    "is a. A hundredth of a second across and so really that&#39;s very, you know very", 
    "quickly and so most a human speeds things like that, they tend to be in the range er", 
    "50 cycles per second up to maybe 20,000 cycles per second. Alright, so the first", 
    "quality I want to talk about, I just used the phrase cycles per second but I never", 
    "explained it, is frequency. So if I go up. So something where there is more and I&#39;m", 
    "gonna, we are gonna say, this is more cycles per seconds. How many ups and downs", 
    "do we pack into what did I say this was a 100th of a second. So when there&#39;s more in", 
    "there. [sound]. That&#39;s what you think of as higher, when you have a note which is", 
    "higher or lower or whatever. Also this is higher so it&#39;s kinda like, this is kinda", 
    "irritating. Okay, sorry, we&#39;ll [inaudible]. [laugh]. All the dogs are", 
    "gonna like leave the building. So that&#39;s what frequency is. You have just a greater", 
    "number of cycles per second. And there&#39;s actually. I&#39;m gonna go a... Well, let&#39;s", 
    "talk about music a little bit. So when you go up one octave, so that&#39;s C to this one,", 
    "to this one. What you think of is kind of a natural sounds repercussion, that&#39;s", 
    "exactly a doubling. So, if I look at the number of cycles there and I go up an", 
    "octave, it&#39;s exactly, exactly a factor of two. We can go up, into the dog range but", 
    "I won&#39;t. Alright, that is one quality of signal of sound. Another [inaudible] which", 
    "is kinda obvious is Official vocabulary word is amplitude, so. In a very analogue", 
    "sense, the height that, that is going up and down corresponds to how the, how big", 
    "the pressure wave is. Right, how hard is the speaker, the synthesizer pushing on", 
    "the air? So if I were to just turn it down. It just like, goes down. So that&#39;s", 
    "what, that&#39;s what loud and soft is. Loud is just, [inaudible], just like you know,", 
    "going out a little harder. So this leaves me with the most kind of baffling quality", 
    "which is called tamber. And that just refers to the shape of the wave, the", 
    "little curly cues, whatever. And the sine wave is like there&#39;s no timbre. It&#39;s just", 
    "like the most vanilla sound possible. So, I&#39;m gonna switch the synthesizer. To do", 
    "like, cheesy, pan flute sound [sound] and what you see, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d tell,", 
    "that&#39;s the same cycles per second I was doing before. It&#39;s actually the same", 
    "frequency, it&#39;s the same note, but it has this flute timbre on it, all the little", 
    "curly cues and stuff on it. And what is amazing is how the brain, that&#39;s what your", 
    "brain is getting. Those little curly cues, and bumps and waggles and God knows what,", 
    "and your brain takes that in and what it hears is. [sound] flute [laugh] but when", 
    "it hears this one it&#39;s like. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, sign waves. &gt;&gt; And, and what. &gt;&gt; That&#39;s", 
    "all a little basic to me... &gt;&gt; Well certainly when we look at it visually just", 
    "as pixels it sort of. Yeah. I have new found respect for the ear, and the brain.", 
    "I really the brain, obviously the brain, The brain helps out there. Alright, So", 
    "what do we have there Frequency, amplitude, timber. That&#39;s just like", 
    "classic, classic stuff to know about, about these sorts of signals. Alright, so", 
    "what I want to talk about Is Another question about how sound works and I&#39;ll go", 
    "back to my [inaudible] here, which is there is just one air. Like in this room,", 
    "there is one body of air and all the sounds in here, basically me talking and", 
    "you all clickety clacketing like [laugh] [inaudible] paying attention or whatever.", 
    "It&#39;s all sharing the one air. And so the question I want to get out is well how is", 
    "it, what happens if multiple sounds are going on in the air at the same time.", 
    "Alright, if there&#39;s, someone&#39;s talking, and then there&#39;s a low note, and a high", 
    "note and you can [inaudible], oh, maybe they just sort of obliterate each other.", 
    "But, that&#39;s not true, really [inaudible] you can hear, obviously, you can here", 
    "multiple things at the same time. And so I wanna get a little bit is like, how does", 
    "that work? How do multiple sounds fit into the one air? And so I&#39;m gonna do that by", 
    "playing multiple notes at one time. Alright, so I&#39;m going to start off with.", 
    "Okay yes, we&#39;ve seen this enough times, my low note, the, the sign wave, so what", 
    "would happen if I played that one, and let&#39;s say this one at the same time. And", 
    "I&#39;ll tell. I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll tell you, and then we&#39;ll look at it. The answer is", 
    "addition. The pressure waves add on top of each other. So, there might be one place", 
    "where one wave is kind of high and other is also kind of high, so they add together", 
    "and they make it like even higher, and there might be other places where one wave", 
    "is kind of high and other is kind of low, so it is just rhythmetic. How do they add", 
    "toge ther, they make composite wave that has both sounds in it. And, um... So it", 
    "just happens which bring out very neatly and visually so I&#39;ll start with the low", 
    "one. And then here&#39;s the high one. [sound] And I&#39;ll just do it at the same time.", 
    "[sound] Oh well, that doesn&#39;t come out quite perfect there. Let me, let me try", 
    "one even a little higher. [sound] So there&#39;s my low one. [sound] There&#39;s my", 
    "high one. If I do it at the same time or if you can kinda see. There&#39;re sort of the", 
    "low one is in there but the just map on top of it is this high one. Okay I like", 
    "everyone would just close your eyes for a second. Just humor me. So now just isolate", 
    "you can here just listen to the high note. Right You can recognize there is a height", 
    "note there or if you want you can also here that there&#39;s the low note. Alright", 
    "you can open your eyes. So looking back [sound] your brain is just getting the", 
    "signal. And this is the amazing part. Your brain gets that, and it can parse out", 
    "[sound] The two sounds that are going into to it. This again gets. I&#39;m impressed with", 
    "the brain how it can like pull that stuff apart. Allrighty, So I&#39;ll show you there&#39;s", 
    "a If you wanted to sort of prove, or show for yourself that it&#39;s just addition you", 
    "can actually do it with graph paper. Where you, you could sort of graph this note,", 
    "which is this one. And then you could graph the note that&#39;s just one octave", 
    "higher. So this one and then this one, Just, just 2X. And then with the graph", 
    "paper, you could sorta add up the components. So where they&#39;re both high", 
    "make it high. And where they&#39;re both low, make it low. And it and what you&#39;ll find", 
    "is that you get. The sort of a, this is the classical one octave apart shape and", 
    "so only guys optional exercise that you could, you could, you could sort of show", 
    "that I&#39;m not just making this up. Alrighty, So let me show you a couple", 
    "other a couple other interesting fact about this summing together of sounds", 
    "There&#39;s sort of an eerie relationship between mathematics and sounds, and in", 
    "particular sounds that sound good and sounds th at don&#39;t sound good and this is", 
    "er, I guess the ancient Greeks were captivated by this and it is kind of", 
    "magical. So, what you think of as a chord in music, what sounds good is when the", 
    "peaks and valleys of two different sounds that you&#39;re going to add together, they", 
    "kind of match up. So, for example, it&#39;s kind of obvious that if I take this note.", 
    "And then I exactly double the frequency, exactly double, then the peaks and the", 
    "valleys are gonna match up perfectly. And so in fact, those sound pretty good", 
    "together So that&#39;s really, that&#39;s what a chord is, is when mathematically it kind", 
    "of divides evenly so the things match up. So we can look at the other side, well so", 
    "wait, what sounds bad? And the way to get it to sound bad is to have one sound be,", 
    "let&#39;s say, at 100 cycles per second. So that, you know, that&#39;s the spacing of the", 
    "piece of valleys. And have another sound which is maybe 100, 100 one cycles per", 
    "second. Just a little bit off. And what you&#39;ll find is then the peaks and the", 
    "valleys, they almost never coincide. The thing is just staggered and it makes kind", 
    "of a mess. And what&#39;s neat about that. Is that there&#39;s something in your brain. So", 
    "here like [sound] there&#39;s a chord where they match up pretty well. Then I&#39;m gonna", 
    "add on one. [sound]. Well like it doesn&#39;t match. That&#39;s discard And what&#39;s amazing", 
    "is how like, it&#39;s not just bothering everyone. It&#39;s like &quot;I&#39;m not happy&quot; and", 
    "then if I just go up, I just go up a little bit so it matches, then like &quot;aah,", 
    "that sounds good&quot;. [laugh] So that&#39;s math, chord and discord. Alright, so let me show", 
    "you. I want to talk about that. You know, we [inaudible] that. So that&#39;s just a", 
    "signal, waves, things like that. So let me bring this over to technology. And", 
    "eventually I want to get at basically like, how a CD player works. Or the CD", 
    "player, I guess that an antique. So we&#39;ll also talk about how mp3&#39;s work. So for", 
    "starters, I got, if I&#39;m gonna talk about Analog versus digital. I, I personally", 
    "want to talk about analog briefly. We talked about this a little bit with my", 
    "viol in example. So, I&#39;ll talk about there&#39;s the, the original telephone", 
    "system, the Alexander Grahambel model. [cough] and I talked about analog a little", 
    "bit before so this very much follows that pattern. The way the original phone system", 
    "work is, you know, we&#39;ve got the person on the left there and they speak, so they", 
    "make pressure waves in the air and it hits a microphone. And. I&#39;m not going into too", 
    "much detail what a microphone does but basically it has little magnet arranged", 
    "next to a diaphragm that can be pushed by the air and so as the air moves the little", 
    "diaphragm back and forth it makes a little tiny electrical current. And so the result", 
    "is. Right, that&#39;s analog. It means when the air cone is pushed a little bit one", 
    "way it&#39;s gonna make the electricity go a little bit one way. When the air cone goes", 
    "the other way the electricity&#39;s gonna go a little bit the other way. And so we end up", 
    "with this perfect. Essentially what the microphone does is, is it&#39;s an analog", 
    "translator. It translates from wave in air pressure over to little pattern of", 
    "electricity in the wires. And that&#39;s like, that&#39;s the classic analog step. Alright,", 
    "so a telephone that takes the electricity by having transformed the signal into", 
    "electricity, well now it can go on the wires. And so it goes down the wires, now", 
    "in reality, the signal is so weak, so there&#39;s gonna be some amplification of the", 
    "electricity, transistors, we talked about before. So it goes down the wires, and", 
    "eventually gets to the other end where it gets to a speaker. A speaker is just the", 
    "reverse of a microphone. So the speaker takes in the electricity, and it has an", 
    "arrangement of magnets and cones, whatever. So that then the electricity", 
    "pushes the cone out or in a little bit. And so it basically recreates the pressure", 
    "wave and so then, then the sound comes out. So this is the original design of the", 
    "telephone system, and what&#39;s funny, is that. Not you guys obviously but you know,", 
    "your parents, people actually have phones in their houses. The last mile of the", 
    "phone system, It st ill works this way. Like once the standard was kinda set and", 
    "you know, everybody had all these zillions of phones out there, it was hard just to", 
    "have something switch day, oh so [inaudible] works differently, it&#39;s", 
    "sometimes called a network effect, but yes, there&#39;s this tremendous inertia,", 
    "where the phone, even though the Central Office of the phone company now works", 
    "completely differently, the end part is still compatible like the way it&#39;s always", 
    "been. Alright, so that is your classic analog structure which is mostly so we can", 
    "make fun of it a little bit. Alright, So what I want to talk about is noise, hiss.", 
    "Like how is it that analog doesn&#39;t sound so great. So, I want you to image this", 
    "signal: This is, you know, I call someone up and I have this beautiful bell like", 
    "signing voice and I just sing this like perfect sign wave. And I just, I just want", 
    "it to be enjoyed by the person at the other end of the phone. So what I&#39;m going", 
    "to do... Well, so, let, let&#39;s say I sing that into the microphone, and it&#39;s", 
    "perfect... What comes out at the other end? Right, it goes down the wire, it goes", 
    "through the microphone, down the wires, and then it [inaudible] and then it comes", 
    "down the speakers in the other end. And the answer is it doesn&#39;t come out looking", 
    "like that. What happens is really there&#39;s a little bit of what we are going to call", 
    "noise. A little bit of error. And I&#39;m gonna. This isn&#39;t real; this is just me", 
    "drawing a model of air. But you can think of the air as sort of like fuzz around", 
    "where the signal was supposed to be. And the sources of error are many right? Well", 
    "maybe the microphone the paper cone was a little rigid I mean it didn&#39;t quite flex", 
    "perfectly for my beautiful singing. And then the magnet has certain electrical", 
    "properties that kinda shape the, the pattern electricity it can make. And then", 
    "the wire has certain qualities where it&#39;s. Most of the signals go through but it. The", 
    "shape of it kind of gets distorted by the wire. All electrical components do distort", 
    "the shape a little bit as the signal goes thro ugh there. And so what I get out of", 
    "the other side you can, you can think of it as like well the signal, you can see", 
    "the signal. But there&#39;s this, and then the term is noise. There&#39;s this noise kind of", 
    "added on top of it. And I&#39;ll tell you, noise has a distinctive sound. You have", 
    "all heard noise. Noise is the hiss. It&#39;s that, [sound], kinda like. So think of", 
    "analog technologies you&#39;ve used, right? So if you ever had, does anyone here have,", 
    "like, cassette tapes? Maybe you got&#39;em from your grandparents or something,", 
    "Anyway, when you play back cassette tapes, mostly, the music would be there. But if", 
    "you turn it up loud enough, or if there was a quiet station, or if there was a", 
    "quiet section, then you&#39;d hear this, like, [sound]. And that is exactly, it&#39;s the", 
    "noise from the tape and the magnets All these sort of various layers that the", 
    "analog was going through. There&#39;s this noise added on top. So er, phones actually", 
    "have this cuz phones are this, sort of, comically old technology for that last", 
    "while, And so, that, or anyway, that&#39;s why Skype sounds so much better than actually,", 
    "actually using a phone. Okay, so that&#39;s, that&#39;s a problem other examples. I guess", 
    "VHS tapes. Those are analog. So in that case, the hiss sort of shows up as,", 
    "[inaudible], pure hiss, pure noise in video is that snow look where the pixels", 
    "are just kind of randomly flashing between black and white and color and stuff. Okay,", 
    "so that&#39;s, whatever, analog. You can do pretty well but it&#39;s not gonna. Oh, AM", 
    "radio. See, all, I need to think of a technology you guys actually use that&#39;s", 
    "analog. So [inaudible] product for the future Am radio has a significant amount", 
    "of hiss."
