    "Hi.", 
    "I'm Nick Parlante at Stanford University and this is CS101.", 
    "CS101 is about the basic features of how computers work.", 
    "And I don't want you to think about the", 
    "computer as some sort of magic box that you", 
    "kind of, you know, interact with everyday but you're a", 
    "little iffy about, yeah what's going on in there.", 
    "Because really, the basics of how", 
    "computers work are understandable by anyone.", 
    "so, in CS101, we're going to really look inside the", 
    "computer and, and get a feel for how it works.", 
    "And indeed, play a little bit with how computers work.", 
    "And ultimately, I would like you to then understand", 
    "what computers can do and what they can't do.", 
    "How they, how they fit into the world.", 
    "I just say that, no computer background at all is require for this course.", 
    "This just assumes nothing beyond the ability to use", 
    "a browser and we're just going to, like, work through it.", 
    "so, if you're curious about computers, you know, this is", 
    "a good next stop, this is the right class room.", 
    "Just a, a brief format note for every video segment like", 
    "this, there's actually a companion doc,", 
    "written document with diagrams and explanations.", 
    "And that's always going to be available for review, even you could", 
    "pause in the middle of the video and look at it", 
    "or maybe later if you were curious about something you could", 
    "always go look at that as another way of getting the information.", 
    "So, I'm going to say that the, the fundamental equation of computers that has", 
    "sort of their essence is, that computers", 
    "are both extremely powerful and profoundly stupid.", 
    "They're powerful in that, a computer can do billions of operations per second.", 
    "It can just rip through data at just an inconceivable speed.", 
    "That's the powerful part.", 
    "But, the computer is very stupid in that, the operations that it can do so quickly.", 
    "Are really very simple.", 
    "So, maybe add two numbers to get a third number, or check if a number is zero.", 
    "So not only are those operations simple, but they're nothing", 
    "like what you would describe as, as insight or understanding, right?", 
    "Just add two numbers.", 
    "Insight and understanding are really human qualities.", 
    "And I want to highlight how the computer", 
    "world is really this mechanical world, and then", 
    "we'll, we'll connect how it is that you can make useful features out of that.", 
    "As was mentioned in movies computers are, they are never shown as mechanical, right?", 
    "It's always essentially a human character that", 
    "has emotions and gets mad or, or whatever.", 
    "And here I have a link to the", 
    "the famous HAL 9000 video segment that represents that.", 
    "So we've got this funny combination, powerful and stupid.", 
    "And I gotta say it will come through very clearly in", 
    "later sections when we start playing with computer code a little bit.", 
    "You will get a vivid sense for that combination.", 
    "But", 
    "just for today,", 
    "well if the computer is so stupid, you know, how is", 
    "it that so many useful features can be implemented up with computers?", 
    "And in a way that's what CSI 101 is about.", 
    "I want to visit the computer world and get a feel", 
    "for this kind of powerful, mechanical world of the computer.", 
    "And then connect that to useful features that we use", 
    "every day and sort of understand what puts all that together.", 
    "Ultimately you know, the goal for this class", 
    "is that you understand how computers work, and in", 
    "particular you're not intimidated that you understand how", 
    "they, how they work and what they can do.", 
    "Also I'll mention in here, I'll highlight my hidden agenda.", 
    "Hidden agenda is that for some people", 
    "taking this class, after we play around inside", 
    "the world of the computer, some people may feel like, wow, that was pretty awesome.", 
    "I really like computers and so my hope is that", 
    "those people would consider taking more classes in computer science.", 
    "Certainly in the Computer Science department,", 
    "it is thought that there are just", 
    "not enough people in the world who", 
    "are really comfortable doing things with computers.", 
    "There are problems we would like solved with computers,", 
    "and there's just not enough people to do it all.", 
    "So, I'm always happy to get more people into the club.", 
    "So, at a high level the operation of a computer is really driven by code.", 
    "And, for today, I'll just describe code as being made up as a series of instructions.", 
    "So, as I mentioned before, maybe add", 
    "two numbers or something really simple like that.", 
    "So here, I have my little drawings.", 
    "So, inside the computer, we've got some body of code and they're just", 
    "a series of instructions or add these two numbers and then compare this, whatever.", 
    "So what the computer does, really is it just has", 
    "a series of instructions and it just does them in order.", 
    "It does this one, and does this one, and does the", 
    "third one, the fourth one, so on, just rips through them.", 
    "When, when you hear the word \"run\" used with computers, that's what it means.", 
    "There's a series of instructions in there, and", 
    "it just rips through them, it just does them.", 
    "Man.", 
    "So yeah, it does them very quickly,", 
    "but the individual instructions are quite simple.", 
    "So I think this leads to a natural question.", 
    "You're like, well, if these instructions are so simple, how", 
    "is it that we can have like a useful feature?", 
    "So here I'm going to use red-eye reduction as", 
    "an example of like, oh that's a useful feature", 
    "a computer can do or like you know,", 
    "email or MP3 audio or, gee, you know, anything.", 
    "So, what, what connects these two sides?", 
    "And the answer is that's what computer programmers do.", 
    "So, a computer programmer maybe has an idea of like oh, yeah, red eye reduction.", 
    "That's a great idea.", 
    "We should have red eye reduction.", 
    "And that's an insight.", 
    "And then the computer programmer thinks of like, well, how could we do that?", 
    "Well we would look for the red color and maybe it's in a round shape or whatever.", 
    "So think through how to do it. And then eventually ultimately", 
    "the computer programmer has to break that algorithm down into simple instructions.", 
    "In a way, sort of dumbing it down into instructions", 
    "that are so simple that the computer can do it.", 
    "And so whenever you've used email or you", 
    "know SMS or some useful feature on the computer,", 
    "it's because there was a comp, a person that", 
    "had the insight like oh, we should do that.", 
    "And the person structured it, sort of broke it down", 
    "for the computer, so that the computer could do it.", 
    "And in a way CS101 is going to, is going to look at this picture.", 
    "Right?", 
    "We're going to examine the left, we're going to look at what code", 
    "looks like and what it's limitations are and what it can do.", 
    "And then I'm going to want to formulate little computer programs", 
    "that we can play with and that you can write", 
    "to try and, you know, see both sides and sort", 
    "of get a feel for how the whole picture works.", 
    "I'm going to say that, I, I like this picture.", 
    "I feel like this is, it's like a, it's a, it's", 
    "a nice combination in that each side brings what it's good at.", 
    "The computer programmer can concentrate on being creative and having", 
    "insight and putting together you know, solving a real problem.", 
    "And then what is the computer good at?", 
    "Well, the computer is good at being inexpensive.", 
    "Right? With Moore's law, which we'll study in", 
    "a little bit, computers are just gradually getting cheaper.", 
    "They can be more widespread, and the computer can", 
    "be inexpensive, and just rip through its instructions very quickly.", 
    "And so, that's great.", 
    "Ultimately, that means we get, you know, solutions", 
    "to many many problems, and they can be widespread.", 
    "That's fantastic.", 
    "So.", 
    "In the, in the next section what I want to do is look a little more closely at code.", 
    "And get to a point where you can start playing with code."
