			One important property of the resulting solution is its ability to conduct electricity.
			Conductivity of a solution can be tested with an apparatus such as the one seen below.
			Solutions that contain charged particles (ions) allow the electric current to flow
			between the anodes. This will complete the circuit and cause the light bulb to light up.
			Substances, like NaCl, that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called

					electrolytes
				</anchor>
				<meaning>
					<material>
						<p>
							substances that produces ions when dissolved in water

			. More specifically NaCl is a

				<meaning>

						<p>
							substance that dissociates or ionizes completely when dissolved in

			because it conducts electricity very well.
